      [H3]12 Defender[h3]

Described as a "micro blaster" in advertising literature, the 12 Defender holdout blaster by Gee-Tech is a weapon of dubious quality and legality. Touted as the smallest, most reliable self-defense blaster for sale in the galaxy," this tiny pistol is a light, easily concealable, low-powered holdout blaster marketed to wealthy individuals such as merchants, entertainers, and politicians. In theory, the 12 Defender is perfect for those who need a bit of personal protection but have no need or desire to carry a larger blaster pistol. In practice, however, this tiny pistol is a cheaply made, largely disposable weapon of questionable reliability. Produced in the millions and possessing no distinguishing markings (not even a serial number) these weapons feature a ceraplas frame coated with a non-reactive polymer case, which makes them incredibly light and nearly invisible to weapon detection systems. They carry only two shots in their integral power pack, and, once fired, cannot be recharged and retain only a small amount of scrap value. 

[P]While the 12 Defender certainly does offer a fair amount of protection for the price, its shoddy construction and lack of versatility limits its usefulness to the average galactic citizen. However, due to its ease of concealment, ability to elude scanners, untraceable components, and disposable nature, this tiny pistol has found an avid following among the criminal classes. 

[P]Add [SE][SE]to a character's Computers and Perception checks when attempting to find a 12 Defender on a person's body. The A 12 Defender may not be reloaded.

      [H3]Light Blaster Pistol[h3]

A good compromise between concealment and power, light blasters are favored by those who often need a firearm—but just as often need to pretend they don't. Smugglers, spies, and rogues who don't want to advertise their shadier side are all likely to carry light blasters. Smaller-framed species tend to favor light blasters as well, simply for their weight and convenience relative to their own body mass. 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: Merr-Sonn Model 44 Blaster Pistol, BlasTech DL-18 Blaster Pistol.

Most spacers carry standard blaster pistols. They pack enough punch to penetrate plastoid armor, have decent range, and are light enough to carry around at all times. Most scoundrels also appreciate the gunslinger-style look of a well-used blaster on their hip. 
[P]Spacefarers who often have to fight aboard ship carry these weapons since the blast is effective against many types of armor, but isn't powerful enough to breach the hull of most vessels. 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: BlasTech DH-17 Blaster, BlasTech SE-14 and SE-14C Blaster Pistol.

      [H3]Heavy Blaster Pistol[h3]

Heavy blasters are for those spacers who definitely want everyone to know they're packing. They're very powerful, sacrificing range, subtlety, and concealment for intimidation and the ability to tear big holes in most anything short of a blast door. Heavy blaster pistols are intended to combine the strength of a blaster rifle with the compactness of a pistol. Though they do not quite succeed at either (being slightly weaker than a blaster rifle and bulkier than a pistol) they still provide an excellent and deadly compromise weapon. Their only major drawback is that they carry fewer shots than either, a trade-off for the increased power. 

[P]Game Masters have the option to spend [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] to force a heavy blaster pistol to run out of ammo (see page 207). 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: BlasTech DL-44 Heavy Blaster Pistol, Merr-Sonn Model 434.

The rifle or carbine blaster is the typical firearm of soldiers and heavy security forces around the galaxy. Their longer barrels propel bolts much farther than blaster pistols, and their heavier cartridges typically trigger a more powerful blast of particles. 

[P]Stormtroopers in service of the Empire carry E-11 blaster rifles with folding stocks. At short range, the rifle can be fired one-handed—just as if it were a heavy pistol. The stock is extended when firing at more distant targets so that the trooper can better stabilize his aim. 
[P][B]Models Include[b]: E-11 Blaster Rifle (multiple manufacturers), BlasTech A280 Blaster Rifle.

      [H3]Heavy Blaster Rifle[h3]

Hunters and snipers often carry blaster rifles loaded with particularly powerful accelerant gas, advanced XCiter technology, large focusing crystals, or some combination of all three. They're designed to fire extremely powerful bolts at large or heavily armored targets and can fire rapid bursts of shots. Heavy blaster rifles are also excellent for sniping humanoid targets. The massive damage they cause sends a powerful message to the victim's associates. 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: BlasTech DLT-1 9, BlasTech RT-97C Heavy Blaster Rifle.

      [H3]Heavy Repeating Blaster[h3]

These deadly weapons are designed to destroy light machinery, armored targets, or opponents in light cover. Heavy repeating blasters (such as the E-Web blaster favored by Imperial stormtroopers) are truly support weapons. They are set up on tripods and powered by portable generators. They require a two-man team, with one soldier serving as the gunner and the other handling the generator and power couplings. In military units, the second operator often monitors a communications array attached to the generator for selection of targets. 

[P]Heavy repeaters are far too unwieldy to fire effectively without a tripod, unless the bearer has truly remarkable strength. Setting up a tripod weapon requires the crew to spend three actions. The cost of the weapon includes a tripod such as the one found on page 193. 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: BlasTech E-Web Repeating Blaster.

      [H3]Bowcaster[h3]

Bowcasters are associated with the Wookiees of Kashyyyk. They are as distinctive to the Wookiees as gaffi sticks are to the Sand People. 
[P]The various quarrels that can be fired from these weapons allow the wielder a great range of options. Standard ammunition consists of metallic bolts accelerated by polarizers astride the barrel tip. This increases the power and velocity of the round so that the heavy projectile reaches ranges equivalent to conventional blasters. 

[P]The standard quarrel is a micro-explosive capable of blasting through armor, metal, or thick flesh—like that of the giant creatures native to Kashyyyk. Other types of quarrels include sonic detonators, flash quarrels that stun and blind, or smoke quarrels designed to create cover for advancing Wookiee warriors. 

[P]Every bowcaster is hand-built for its user—hence the exorbitant cost. Most require significant strength to cock, but automatic re-cocking mechanisms are one of the most common modifications (Chewbacca's bowcaster has automatic re-cocking, as well as a low-light scope). 

[P]The bowcaster presented here fires standard micro-explosive quarrels, and does not have an automatic re-cocking mechanism. It requires the user to spend a maneuver cocking the weapon before each shot. 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: Unique designed weapon.

      [H3]Ionization Blaster[h3]

These anti-droid weapons work by combining the power pack of a blaster rifle with a typical droid restraining bolt. Somewhat contrary to its name, the bolt doesn't disable a droid mechanically, but instead attaches to its housing and issues a broadcast command to halt that cannot be refused. The ionization blaster amplifies the command via the blasters power pack to a range of about 12 meters in a wide, unfocused arc. 

[P]Organic life forms feel no more than a brief sting, but droids are blasted with the halt command and simultaneously overloaded with energy that prevents any shielding that might resist it. Most droids are rendered inert for up to half an hour when hit by a successful ionization blast (reflected in the stun damage). 

[P]Ionization blasters work only on droids and cyborgs, and only deal strain damage as per their Stun quality. They have no effect on organic beings beyond a brief and painful sting. Models Include: Jawa scavenged ion blaster, Merr-Sonn DEMP 2 Ion Carbine.

      [H3]Disruptor Rifle[h3]

Illegal throughout most of the civilized worlds, disruptors focus such a highly energized beam of particles that they can disintegrate limbs or other large parts of their victim's bodies. The technology is essentially that of a blaster rifle, but with an oversized XCiter and 
a specialized actuating module that processes a much higher volume of blaster gas than usual. This combines with a galven cylinder that super-focuses the resultant beam. Most disruptor weapons have a very poor range, although some rifle variants have a boosted range through expensive reinforced galven cylinders and are designed specifically for snipers and sharpshooters. 

[P]The Tenloss Syndicate manufactures one of the few mass-produced disruptors, the DXR-6 rifle and the DX-2 pistol. Their main client is the notorious Black Sun criminal organization, but they also service a smattering of ruthless rogues and other scoundrels. A few Imperial inquisitors and interrogators have been known to brandish these weapons as well, but perhaps more for the intimidation and terror factor than their practicality. 

[P]Whenever a victim is hit by a disruptor, any Critical Hit results in a °Crippled" effect unless the roll on [B]Table 6-10[b] would result in an even more grievous injury. 

[P]Disruptors may never benefit from upgrades or attachments that improve their range or grant multiple shots. 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: Tenloss DXR-6 Disruptor Rifle, Ten-loss DX-2 Disruptor Pistol.

Short, compact, and loud, these small weapons are very rare. Those who wield them frequently do so because they have some sentimental value, perhaps handed down to them from some distant relative from a low-tech world, or because these weapons are all that's easily available on their world. 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: Oriolanis Striker Projectile Pistol.

      [H3]Slugthrower Rifle[h3]

A larger version of the slugthrower pistol, the slugthrower rifle also uses chemical reactions to fire a solid projectile "slug" at high velocities towards a target. Slugthrower rifles sport much longer and larger barrels than pistols, and can fire larger slugs over longer distances. However, they still suffer from poor accuracy and penetration, not to mention requiring uncommon ammunition that may either be hand-made and unreliable or prohibitively expensive. 
[P]However, many primitive and nomadic cultures use slugthrower rifles, often of some homemade variant. One such example are the Tusken Raiders of Tatooine. The primitive and violent nomads have little access to the kind of gas used by blasters and even less to XCiter technology. They are able to occasionally capture ammunition in raids on the planet's moisture farms, however, and use the rounds in their crude, long-range sniper rifles. These weapons are quite effective against the lone settlers, diminutive Jawas, and womp rats that share their harsh desert.

      [H3]Bola or Net[h3]

Sometimes a bounty hunter has to capture a foe alive rather than dead. Bolas and nets are both used to entangle a victim so that he can be approached and secured—usually for delivery to an authority or criminal organization. Both weapons are designed to be thrown or launched over short distances to ensnare an opponent. Although a stun weapon is easier to use, bolas and nets do have several advantages. Their low-tech construction means they are unlikely to show up on weapons scanners, and stun weapons have sometimes been known to deal lasting damage to a target. 

[P]Bolas and nets rely on the Ensnare quality of the weapons to incapacitate the user, meaning they require more than simply a successful hit. Due to the great deal of skill required, only those who are very talented or extremely desperate tend to use bolas or nets. Most individuals rely on the stun setting of a blaster to bring their target down. 

[P]The user may spend a [TR] to ensure the victim is so entangled that he may not make any maneuvers, and his only action each turn is a [B]Formidable ([DI][DI][DI][DI][DI]) Athletics check[b] to free himself.

Flame-producing devices are primarily used to destroy material such as structures or crops, rather than as anti-personnel weapons. Of course, they excel at scorching flesh and bone as well. 

[P]Flame projectors are popular partially because of their wide and indiscriminate cone of fire, able to catch several individuals in a gout of flame. When triggering the weapon's Burn quality, the user may choose to apply it to any one target hit by the attack; this quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time. However, the GM can spend [TH][TH] or [DE] to apply the weapon's Burn quality to an ally hit by the original attack.

      [H3]Missile Tube[h3]

Missile tubes are heavy, portable devices that launch rocket-powered projectiles. Most fire proton-charged warheads designed to destroy small transports, but other types of ammunition can occasionally be found. 

[P]Missile tubes are elaborate affairs, equipped with micro-repulsorlifts that make them easier for infantry soldiers to carry, as well as advanced tracking screens to detect a target's speed, range, and energy signature. The latter is particularly important because missile tubes can be fired in one of three modes. The first is infrared, which homes in on a craft's heat signature. The second is gravity-activated mode, which means it tracks a target's repulsorlift. Both of these modes can be spoofed, either by dropping burning flares to distract heat sensors or small repulsorlift pods as chaff. See the Guided weapon quality to handle these two modes of attack. 

[P]The third firing method is direct-fire. This requires more skill but sends the projectile in a straight line that cannot be spoofed by chaff or flares (and loses the Guided quality). Of course, if another target happens to get in the way, or if the attacker's aim is off, the missile will hit whatever is in its path without discrimination. Missile tubes require one preparation maneuver before firing. 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: Merr-Sonn PLX-2M Missile Tube.

      [H3]Frag Grenade[h3]

A great variety of grenades can be found throughout the galaxy, from hand-made explosives created with organic shells on primitive worlds to mass-produced metallic casings filled with jagged shards of metal. All fulfill the same basic purpose—to cause as much damage and mayhem as possible over a large area. 

[P]Frag grenades are very effective against unarmored targets, rending exposed flesh and causing massive concussive damage to soft tissues. They are significantly dampened by armor, such as that worn by Imperial stormtroopers. Those who wonder why the Empire's foot soldiers wear armor that cannot stop blaster fire have likely never seen them emerge from the smoke and ruin of a frag grenade unharmed. 

[P]Frag grenades can be set to detonate on impact or set with a timer to detonate up to 3 rounds after being activated at the beginning of the attacker's action. Some also have a "dead man's" or pressure switch that, once pressed, detonates immediately upon release. 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: Merr-Sonn C-22.

Stun grenades use sonic waves, concussion shocks, and other methods to stun their targets. 

[P]Like frag grenades, stun grenades can be set to detonate on impact or set with a timer to detonate up to 3 rounds after being activated. Stun grenades rarely have pressure detonators.

      [H3]Thermal Detonator[h3]

These insidious devices are the size of frag grenades, but have a thermite-baradium casing surrounding a baradium core. On detonation, the resulting fusion reaction creates a particle wave that disintegrates everything in the blast. Most authorities ban thermal detonators because of baradium's instability. One detonator can level a building. 

[P]When using a thermal detonator, any [DE] result on the check means the detonator explodes prematurely. The wielder takes full damage from the weapon unless he can perform an additional maneuver to try to get clear; in this case, he only suffers the Blast damage. 

[P]Thermal detonators can be set to detonate on impact or set with a timer to detonate up to 3 rounds after being activated at the beginning of the attacker's action. Some also have a pressure switch that, once pressed, detonates immediately upon release. Thermal detonators are so potent that their Blast quality affects everyone within short range of the original target. 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: Merr-Sonn Class-A Thermal Detonator.

Dirty fighters and those looking to protect their fists from the tough hides of certain alien species rely on metallic knuckles, gauntlets, or other hand or limb coverings. Hoodlums on some worlds refer to them as "negotiation enhancers." 

[P]Another great advantage of brass knuckles is their ability to be concealed in a pocket or other compartment until they're needed. Add one [SE] die to a characters Perception check when attempting to find brass knuckles on a person's body.

The Tusken Raiders of Tatooine carry brutal staves made from desert tracti hardwood, krayt dragon horn or bone, or scavenged metal. One end of the gaffi stick is flanged with four protruding blades useful for cutting and gashing opponents. The other end curves outward and ends in a spike of some sort, with the opposite side serving as a dull club. While to some the gaffi stick seems crude, its genius is its versatility—being able to stab, cut, or club depending on how the user wields it. It has practical uses as well, from serving as a walking stick in the rough terrain of Tatooine to guiding the Tusken Raiders' massive banthas. 

[P]Gaffi sticks require two hands to wield.

Force pikes are one-meter long metallic staves topped with power-tips. One setting on the power-tip vibrates powerfully enough to shatter flesh, steel, and stone. The other setting provides an electric shock that can be set relatively low to prod or control, or high to cause excruciating pain or death. Either setting is designed for ease of use—it takes little skill to swing a stick and cause devastating injury with the vibro or electricity setting. In the hands of a skilled user, however, it's almost as powerful as a lightsaber. 

[P]When used with its Stun Setting, a Force Pike does not benefit from the Pierce 2 Quality. Force pikes require two hands to wield.

      [H3]Lightsaber[h3]

The weapon of the Jedi is rare in [B]Edge of the Empire[b]. The rogues and scoundrels of the galaxy do not travel in the same circles as these revered knights. When such an individual is encountered, tainted souls may want to steer clear, for their weapons are made of pure energy and can slice through anything—from limbs to blast doors.

[P]Lightsabers normally require the Lightsaber skill to wield. However, since that skill is not an option for the Player Characters in this book, players must use a lightsaber untrained (selecting either Brawn or Agility as the base characteristic). This is deliberate, because there are few people in the galaxy who properly know how to fight with a lightsaber. However, if the GM feels it is warranted, he can create the Lightsaber skill as a custom skill for his players. Lightsabers cannot be sundered.

Truncheons may be made of metal, wood, bone or other materials, but all fulfill the same basic function—bruising flesh, breaking bones, and cracking skulls. Police forces around the galaxy use truncheons to intimidate and control protesters or petty thieves. Enlightened areas prefer this to lethal force.

      [H3]Vibro-Ax[h3]

Gamorreans, particularly those employed by the notorious Hutts, often carry meter-long axes fitted with vibration technology. Most are very heavy and suited only for beings of considerable strength, and usually with a low center of gravity (particularly tall or elegant beings have trouble swinging the heavy axes without throwing themselves off-balance). 

[P]The damage a vibro-ax causes is tremendous and messy. The impact area suffers massive and deep trauma from the blade and the vibration. Because of this, wounds caused by vibro-axes are particularly nasty—hence the high damage and Critical Hit chance. A vibro-ax requires two hands to wield. 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: SoroSuub BD-1 Cutter Vibro-Ax.

      [H3]Vibroknife[h3]

A vibroknife is essentially a modded combat knife, but since they have proven so effective, they have become manufactured as such throughout the galaxy. The basic premise is simple—a small but powerful device within the knife's handle vibrates the blade at an incredibly high frequency so that it essentially acts as a miniature saw. Vibroknives aren't as powerful as lightsabers against most substances, but one need not be a Jedi to wield it effectively. 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: Merr-Sonn Treppus-2 Vibroblade.

Many galactic civilizations have long taken to improving the simple but effective blade with induced ultra-sonic vibrations. The high frequency vibrations of the cutting edge greatly improve the sharpness of the weapon, allowing it to carve through most materials with ease. 

[P]There are many variations of vibroblade, but the vibrosword is fairly common amongst those who fancy themselves duelists.

      [H3]Proton Torpedo Launcher[h3]

Proton torpedoes are highly advanced anti-ship projectiles typically carried by starfighters and patrol boats. They are larger and bulkier than concussion missiles and have a squat, conical warhead, meaning their launchers carry fewer rounds than an equivalent concussion missile launcher. These weapons mount a deadly, irradiating, proton-scattering warhead detonated by a volatile Nergon-14 explosive charge. Proton torpedoes are designed to damage and destroy large vessels like bulk transports and capital ships. They allow small ships like starfighters and patrol boats to punch well above their weight. 

[P]Additional proton torpedoes cost 750 credits each and are Restricted.

Massive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships. Turbolasers can punch clean through an opponent's shields, armor, and hull with a single blast; the lightest easily hulling small ships and the heaviest battering down the defenses of the largest cruiser. The trade-offs are their heavy power requirements, their slow recharge time, and their difficulty in tracking and hitting small, fast targets like starfighters.

Tractor beams are modified shield generators that project a beam of energy that can ensnare starships. Used on orbital shipyards, planetary starports, space stations, and many starships, tractor beams are commonly used to guide vessels safely into slips and docking bays, as well as to handle cargo. When mounted to warships, they can be used offensively to capture enemy vessels and draw them into docking bays for ease of boarding.

The more common and less powerful of the two types of shipboard ordnance, concussion missiles are found on all manner of spacecraft, from tiny starfighters to capital ships. Roughly a meter long, a concussion missile employs special warheads, combining a hardened durasteel penetrator that uses kinetic force to pierce through a ship's armor and a shaped high-explosive charge that causes damage through both explosive force and concussive shock. Concussion missiles are primarily anti-fighter weapons, used to quickly deal crippling damage to starfighters and patrol boats, although they perform well against larger targets as well.

[P]Concussion grenades are primarily a personal scale weapon, although many military ground vehicles mount concussion grenade launchers that fire larger anti-infantry or anti-armor versions. Concussion grenade launchers are typically relatively short range ballistic weapons, and thus are useless in space combat. 

[P]Additional concussion missiles cost 500 credits each and are Restricted.

The standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship. Preferred over blaster cannons for their damage and accuracy, laser cannons can be paired in batteries or mounted separately. Light and medium laser cannons are often found on starfighters and freighters. Heavy laser cannons are mounted to capital ships as secondary weapons to deal with smaller ships. Lasers are also often mounted to military ground vehicles.

Ion weapons are anti-ship and anti-vehicle weapons designed to disable rather than destroy their targets. They use ion turbine generators to create masses of negatively charged particles which are fused with plasma and released as blasts or pulses. The negatively charged particles interfere with a target's electrical systems, shorting circuits, corrupting computers, and forcing system shutdowns in an effort to subdue a target or make it easier to destroy via more traditional means. Although designed to do little-to-no physical damage to targets, collateral damage such as fried circuits, fused joints, and even fires may occur due to the intense energy surges.

Known colloquially as "flash cannons," blaster cannons are heavy, crew-served versions of the common personal blaster. Although they are less powerful than laser cannons, blaster cannons are highly effective against infantry and light vehicles and are typically found mounted to atmospheric vehicles or smaller spaceships. Blaster cannons come in several versions of varying power.

      [H3]Light Ion Cannon[h3]

Ion weapons are anti-ship and anti-vehicle weapons designed to disable rather than destroy their targets. They use ion turbine generators to create masses of negatively charged particles which are fused with plasma and released as blasts or pulses. The negatively charged particles interfere with a target's electrical systems, shorting circuits, corrupting computers, and forcing system shutdowns in an effort to subdue a target or make it easier to destroy via more traditional means. Although designed to do little-to-no physical damage to targets, collateral damage such as fried circuits, fused joints, and even fires may occur due to the intense energy surges.

Massive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships. Turbolasers can punch clean through an opponent's shields, armor, and hull with a single blast; the lightest easily hulling small ships and the heaviest battering down the defenses of the largest cruiser. The trade-offs are their heavy power requirements, their slow recharge time, and their difficulty in tracking and hitting small, fast targets like starfighters.

Tractor beams are modified shield generators that project a beam of energy that can ensnare starships. Used on orbital shipyards, planetary starports, space stations, and many starships, tractor beams are commonly used to guide vessels safely into slips and docking bays, as well as to handle cargo. When mounted to warships, they can be used offensively to capture enemy vessels and draw them into docking bays for ease of boarding.

The rifle or carbine blaster is the typical firearm of soldiers and heavy security forces around the galaxy. Their longer barrels propel bolts much farther than blaster pistols, and their heavier cartridges typically trigger a more powerful blast of particles. 

[P]Stormtroopers in service of the Empire carry E-11 blaster rifles with folding stocks. At short range, the rifle can be fired one-handed—just as if it were a heavy pistol. The stock is extended when firing at more distant targets so that the trooper can better stabilize his aim. 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: E-11 Blaster Rifle (multiple manufacturers), BlasTech A280 Blaster Rifle.

      [H3]Disruptor Pistol[h3]

Illegal throughout most of the civilized worlds, disruptors focus such a highly energized beam of particles that they can disintegrate limbs or other large parts of their victim's bodies. The technology is essentially that of a blaster rifle, but with an oversized XCiter and 
a specialized actuating module that processes a much higher volume of blaster gas than usual. This combines with a galven cylinder that super-focuses the resultant beam. Most disruptor weapons have a very poor range, although some rifle variants have a boosted range through expensive reinforced galven cylinders and are designed specifically for snipers and sharpshooters. 

[P]The Tenloss Syndicate manufactures one of the few mass-produced disruptors, the DXR-6 rifle and the DX-2 pistol. Their main client is the notorious Black Sun criminal organization, but they also service a smattering of ruthless rogues and other scoundrels. A few Imperial inquisitors and interrogators have been known to brandish these weapons as well, but perhaps more for the intimidation and terror factor than their practicality. 

[P]Whenever a victim is hit by a disruptor, any Critical Hit results in a °Crippled" effect unless the roll on [B]Table 6-10[b] would result in an even more grievous injury. 

[P]Disruptors may never benefit from upgrades or attachments that improve their range or grant multiple shots. 

[P][B]Models Include[b]: Tenloss DXR-6 Disruptor Rifle, Ten-loss DX-2 Disruptor Pistol.

      [H3]Electromagnetic Harpoon[h3]

Mounted in a remote-operated turret aft of the cockpit, the T-47's electromagnetic harpoon was designed with towing in mind. Controlled by the speeder's systems operator, or by the pilot in a pinch, the harpoon consists of a pneumatic cannon that launches a short durasteel rod connected to a few dozen yards of high-tensile braided cable. The rod is tipped with a powerful electromagnetic disc that receives its power through the harpoon's cable, which is in turn connected to a powerful winch located in the hull beneath the cannon. While not a weapon per se, the harpoon can be used to knock down personnel or droids, move obstacles, ensnare large creatures or vehicles, and generally create havoc, hence its Knockdown and Ensnare qualities.

      [H3]x-30 Lancer[h3]
      
Lightweight and easy to use, SoroSuub's X-30 Lancer is one of the most popular sporting blasters on the market. Designed with competition shooters and pistol hunters in mind, the Lancer is optimized for range, accuracy, and stopping power. Built to SoroSuub's exacting standards, the Lancer is a sleek, modern-looking blaster pistol with a long barrel and a weighted, finely balanced stock. Firing a blaster bolt that is well out of scale for a weapon its size, it uses a custom-formulated, highly volatile mix of blaster gasses and a supercharged actuating module to fire intense, highly concentrated bolts accurately over long distances. Superior galven patterns in the barrel reduce beam degradation and dispersal, allowing the pistol to maintain effectiveness well past the range of other weapons of its class. 

[P]In the Outer Rim, Lancer pistols are relatively common, especially among those who need a powerful weapon in a lightweight package. Many speeders and atmospheric craft have one of these fine pistols tucked away in an easy-to-reach storage locker, and many starships include them in their escape pods and emergency kits as a defensive weapon. They are also especially popular among explorers and scholars for their easy handling characteristics, as well as by those big-game hunters who enjoy the challenge of pistol hunting.

    <Name>E-11S Sniper Rifle</Name>
    <Description>
      [H3]E-11S Sniper Rifle[h3]

Developed from the venerable E-11 blaster rifle, BlasTech's E-11s was designed primarily as a dedicated marksman's rifle for use by the Galactic Empire. A large, sleek, and deadly-looking weapon, the E-11s is nearly as long as a grown human is tall, with a shroud-ed barrel that makes up fully half of its length. Excellent balance and precision-fit components help compensate for this, however, and the E-11 s is quite easy to carry and shoot for a weapon of its size. The E-1Is is incredibly popular among the Empire's scout and reconnaissance forces, whose missions typically see them operating in conditions where the long range and pinpoint accuracy of a dedicated sniper weapon can be used to their fullest potential. In the field, the E-11s grants a small reconnaissance squad incredible reach and allows them to project their force at ranges unmatched by most military units. Officially, the E-11 s carries a restricted rating, limiting it to governmental, military, and law-enforcement use only. That being said, more than a few of these powerful rifles have fallen out of the backs of speeder trucks, so to speak. Those that have found their way into civilian hands make for excellent hunting and sniping weapons, and their performance nearly makes up for the serious risks involved in owning them. 

[P]E-11s rifles are equipped with relatively light-weight, matte-finish composite furniture that absorbs light, a fixed stock, and a powerful multioptical telescopic sight. The rifle's firing mechanism uses a supercharged actuating module, upgraded exciter, and extremely volatile, highly compressed blaster gasses to increase the range and penetration of the blaster bolt. This extra power has the added side effect of reducing refraction and beam degradation, allowing it to maintain both its penetration and stopping power at incredible range. While this makes for a powerful weapon, especially in the hands of a talented marksman, it also makes for a weapon that consumes quite a bit of energy and as such has a limited ammunition capacity (a rarity in blasters). These rifles also emit an enormous amount of heat when firing, thanks to their supercharged firing systems. To compensate for this, the E-11 s has a slow rate of fire to allow for cool-down, and the barrel is insulated with a triple-redundant nitrogen cooling system.

    <Description>
      [H3]LBR-9 Stun Rifle[h3]

Stun rifles are rare weapons in the galaxy, perceived by most to be of limited utility. Possessing low-intensity blast-actuating modulators and using a lower yield mix of blast gasses than other, more lethal blaster rifles, stun rifles are capable of only nonlethal stunning blasts. Most of these weapons are used in law enforcement, corrections, and occasionally in bounty hunting, fields in which the need to keep targets alive is often of paramount importance. They are typically short ranged, and their bolts have a broad spread to catch as many targets in their blast as possible. While this is effective in close quarters or in large crowds, in open terrain their effectiveness is sadly reduced. To counter this, and to corner the market in long-range stun blasters, BlasTech recently released the all-new LBR-9 Stun Rifle. 

[P]Based on the current model DL-87 Firespray stun rifle, the LBR-9 is a long-barreled, light-framed blaster rifle fitted with composite furniture and simple iron sights. Using the majority of the Firespray's firing system with an upgraded galven pattern designed to fit the longer barrel, the LBR-9 can fire a concentrated, high-penetration stun bolt with a range and accuracy commensurate with other, more lethal weapons in its class. With its optimized and upgraded galven pattern and a patented mix of blaster gasses, the LBR-9 packs quite a punch and typically needs only one or two shots to knock a target out of commission. Only recently brought to market and largely sold to Core Systems' planetary law-enforcement agencies, few of these specialized weapons have found their way to the fringes of civilized space. Those that do are quickly snatched up by both beast and bounty hunters for their precise handling characteristics and nonlethal nature, and they are gaining a reputation as finely made, accurate, and dependable weapons.

      [H3]Model 77 Air Rifle[h3]

Air rifles are not considered weapons on most planets in the galaxy, and the majority of sentients therein see them as little more than toys. Even those Core Worlds with the most draconian restrictions on weapon ownership have no official laws governing air-powered weapons. A specialized form of slugthrower, air rifles use compressed air or other gasses to propel tiny metal pellets or light, spin-stabilized darts over long distances. Lightweight and extremely accurate, they are usually marketed to hobby shooters, collectors, or those who need a quiet, easy-to-use, and relatively safe weapon with which to practice their marksmanship. 

[P]These weapons' balance, accuracy, portability, and the nearly complete silence of their firing mechanism make them excellent weapons for hunters, both of beasts and of sentient beings. Combined with the ability to chamber specialty darts that can be filled with various chemicals and toxins, air weapons make for fine silent killing weapons. 

[P]One of the most common air rifles on the market is the Model 77 from Field Sports, a trusted name in air-weapon production. Known colloquially as the Sandman, thanks to the unique effects of its standard ammunition, the Model 77 is a lightweight, long-barreled air gun similar in silhouette and stature to a sporting blaster. Made primarily of polycarbonate with fibermesh reinforcement, the Model 77 was initially marketed as a nonlethal weapon for animal control and law enforcement. It fires tiny, spin-stabilized darts with laser-honed tips capable of piercing the thickest hide from a detachable clip that is quick and easy to reload. Each dart contains a dose of tranquilizer agent that induces unconsciousness. In addition, the Model 77's darts can be loaded with the heavy-duty "SmartTranq" tranquilizer with an active ingredient that adapts itself upon contact with the target's bloodstream to be as effective as possible no matter what the species. Sandman air rifles have a well-deserved reputation for accuracy and reliability. In the Outer Rim many are used by bounty hunters and big-game hunters who need to take prey alive in order to collect their payments.

      [H3]Model 38 Sharpshooter's Rifle[h3]

For millennia, Czerka Arms has maintained a reputation as a purveyor of fine arms and armor for both the military and civilian markets. While they have an impressive and diversified catalog of offensive and defensive products ranging from sporting blasters and vibroblades to flame cannons and combat droids, they are perhaps best known for producing a successful line of fine slugthrowing pistols and rifles. 

[P]A throwback to a more primitive age, slugthrowers are considered anachronistic and unwieldy by most sentients. However, Czerka's line of slugthrowers, which they refer to as "Legacy Arms," has proven modestly successful, especially among the beings of the Outer Rim. Some of their Legacy Arms clients are collectors or historians, others are farmers or colonists who appreciate the affordability and ruggedness of these firearms, and some simply prefer the visceral noise and flash of a chemical-propelled slug over the cool precision of a blaster. Whatever their reasons, whether preference or necessity, Czerka is the popular choice for slugthrowers. 

[P]One of Czerka's more popular Legacy Arms is the Model 38 Sharpshooter's Rifle. Marketed to hunters, and tacitly to snipers and assassins, the Model 38 is an extremely powerful, accurate, long-range rifle with incredible destructive potential. A long and finely crafted weapon, each Model 38 is custom built to the customer's specifications. It chambers a powerful, large-caliber round with a specially coated penetrating bullet that can pierce even the toughest hides. The rifle is operated by means of a simple and rugged bolt action and fed by a five-round detachable clip. Their stocks and other furniture are typically either light-weight composites or polished, exotic hardwoods, depending on the customer's tastes. 

[P]New rifles must be ordered in person from a certified Czerka Arms dealer, at which time the customer is measured for fit and his shooting style is analyzed in an on-site simulator. This allows the Czerka Arms rep to determine the best possible configuration for the rifle in relation to its new owner and to offer advice on further customization. 

[P]Once the rifle is completed and delivered, it is as closely matched to the new shooter's stance, stature, and habits as art and artifice can make it. This makes the rifles incredibly accurate at any range, as the custom fit and frame makes the Model 38 point and shoot as if it were an extension of the shooter's body. Most Model 38 rifles in the Outer Rim are owned by hunters and marksmen for hire who ordered them directly from Czerka. There are some of these highly prized rifles on the used market, although they typically need serious modification before a new owner can use them to their full potential. If purchased used, a Czerka Model 38 loses the Accurate 2 quality until the rifle can be modified to fit the new shooter (requiring a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b]).

    <Name>KS-23 Hammer</Name>
    <Description>
      [H3]KS-23 Hammer[h3]

The KS-23 is yet another popular slugthrowing design by Czerka Arms. A rarity even among the already scarce slugthrowing class of weapons, the KS-23 fires a canister of small explosive pellets instead of a single long-range, precision slug. When fired, these pellets scatter from the barrel to fill a wide area with as much destructive potential as possible. Brutally effective at short and medium ranges, this weapon is known unofficially as the "Hammer." 

[P]The KS-23 was initially produced as a hunting weapon to take down extremely hardy beasts like the krayt dragon or rancor. They are roughly the size of a blaster carbine, with a large-caliber smoothbore barrel, a sturdy action, and composite stocks and furniture. The ammunition is stored in a tubular, five-round magazine that runs under the barrel, and the firing mechanism is self-loading and uses the weapon's recoil for power. An extremely unsubtle weapon, the KS-23 is loud and has a powerful recoil thanks to the large-bore, high-powered ammunition it fires. 

[P]Thanks to its rugged construction and powerful ammunition, the KS-23 has gained a wide following in the Outer Rim. Easy to maintain and repair and built from high-quality, resilient materials, the Hammer stands up exceedingly well to the kinds of abuse equipment suffers in the wild places of the galaxy. Used primarily by big-game hunters, these weapons have also found their way into the armories of explorers, smugglers, pirates, and even some planetary law-enforcement agencies who appreciate their power and utility.

      [H3]AO14 "Aranea" Net Gun[h3]

The Palandrix Personal Protection Gear company has been a leading provider of personal armor, defensive weapons, and crowd-control devices to the Core Worlds for generations. Known primarily for its broad range of nonlethal weapons such as stun batons, sonic stunners, and stun gauntlets, the company also produce a small line of offensive weapons, including the handsome and deadly PowerCane. Among its various product lines are a few devices that don't fall neatly into any one category, possessing both defensive and offensive attributes that make them extremely versatile and effective. One such item is the A014 "Aranea" Net Gun.

[P]Heavy and squat, the Aranea is roughly the size of a small blaster carbine with a wide-gauge, rifled barrel, and lightweight polycarbonate furniture. Officially classified as a grenade launcher, the A014 is a single-shot, break-action, breach-loading weapon that fires entangling munitions as opposed to slugs or blaster bolts. The 40mm spin-stabilized ammunition used by the Aranea contains a tightly packed, weighted, finemesh net constructed from synthetic ArachSilk made by CorChemCo. Upon firing, the shells fired by this weapon burst open at a preset range and release the net, the spin of the round causing the net to unfurl and the weights spreading it to its maximum width. With its incredibly strong tensile strength and the ability to tighten around an opponent as he struggles, the Aranea's nets make excellent tools for capturing animal and sentient targets alive.

      [H3]Glop Grenade[h3]

Merr-Sonn's ingenious G-20 Glop Grenade is a reusable, less-than-lethal antipersonnel grenade used to suppress rioters and capture fugitives alive. Roughly the size of a thermal detonator, the G-20 is a small metallic sphere covered in spray nozzles. As a trigger, glop grenades are equipped with a timer that can be set to detonate on contact or set to detonate after a delay of up to fifteen seconds. Inside the sphere is a refillable reservoir that holds a semiliquid foam that instantly hardens upon contact with oxygen. When deployed, the user sets his detonation time and simply throws it at his target. When it detonates, the grenade sprays its quick-hardening foam over a broad area, trapping everything in its range in a thick, nearly unbreakable substance that is almost as strong as ferrocrete. The hardened foam is only good for around five minutes, after which it begins to break down and becomes brittle and easy to shatter.

[P]A glop grenade's Ensnare quality triggers automatically on any targets the weapon hits, with no need to spend [AD]. 

[P]While glop grenades are ostensibly rated as nonlethal, accidents do happen, and they have been known to cause death due to suffocation or, in extremely rare cases, allergic reactions to the foam. Whenever a target is hit with a glop grenade, he must make an [B]Easy ([DI]) Coordination check[b] to keep the foam from filling his breathing passages. Failure on the skill check indicates that the foam has cut off the target's air, and he immediately suffers the effects of suffocation as detailed on page 214 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rulebook. 

[P]Glop grenades that are recovered after use can be refilled with special pressurized hypoinjectors that transfer the foam from a sealed container into the grenade's reservoir without exposing it to the atmosphere. This requires an [B]Easy ([DI]) Ranged (Light) check[b] to complete. Failure on the check indicates that the foam has been ruined, and any net [TH] gained on a failed skill check means that some mishap with the filling system occurs and the user is engulfed in quickly hardening goo. This doesn't require an attack roll, but it does require the user to make an [B]Easy ([DI]) Coordination check[b] to avoid getting the goo in his nose or mouth per the rules above. Purchase of a Glop Grenade includes the hypoinjector and five refill canisters. Additional refill canisters can be purchased for 100 credits apiece and have a rarity of 6.

    [H3]G9-GP Pulse Drill[h3]

Makers of the venerable G2-GE beamdrill, Karflo Corporation is a Corporate Sector-based conglomerate with interests in industrial mining, droid production, and planetary exploration. Their G-series beamdrills are used throughout the galaxy in industries as widely varied as computer production and deep-space asteroid mining. They use variable-strength continuous-beam plasma projectors to burn through earth, stone, metals, and nearly any organic or inorganic substance in their path. They can perform any kind of cutting or burning task, from gently melting lightweight polymers to vaporizing waste materials and industrial byproducts. Recently, Karflo Corporation has been exploring smaller, more portable versions of their powerful beamdrills for use by planetary explorers and archaeologists. Their first attempt at this market is the G9-GP Pulse Drill. 

[P]The G9-GP is a handheld, low-powered, precision beamdrill designed for work in excavation and light duty mining. They appear as long, bulky rods with a tank at one end and a variable-angle plasma cutter at the other. The beam emitted by the G9-GP is a rapidly pulsing plasma beam around a millimeter thick with an adjustable range that allows it to cut through relatively thick material. While they are primarily tools, their plasma beams make excellent improvised weapons in an emergency, and more than a few explorers have had their lives or limbs saved from a surprise attack by quick application of the pulse drill.

      [H3]Huntsman Vibrospear[h3]

The Huntsman by LaserHone, a maker of fine vibroweapons based in the Corporate Sector, is a relative oddity among weapons of its class. Over two meters long, the Huntsman is a sturdy vibrospear designed for hunting large and dangerous wild game. Equipped with LaserHone's patented ultrasonic vibrotechnology, the vibrogenerator in the Huntsman vibrates at frequencies well outside the hearing range of most sentients. The ultrasonic vibrogenerator, special dampening fittings, and a coating of sound-absorbing polymers make the Huntsman completely silent when active. This allows a hunter to carry a powerful vibroweapon in the field without the fear of spooking his prey with the noise from the weapon. 

[P]The Huntsman's haft is a super-dense plasteel alloy embedded with sound-deadening materials and laced with foil-fiber reinforcements. Incredibly strong and flexible, the Huntsman can parry nearly any incoming blow, from the claws of a powerful beast to the slashing edge of a vibro-ax. The blade is a long, thin, leaf-shaped affair made from a laser-honed steel alloy with a molecular edge that can pass through steel and stone as easy as through flesh and muscle. At the base of the blade where it meets the haft, two thick posts extend for a few centimeters perpendicular to the haft to prevent particularly recalcitrant beasts from charging up the haft after being stabbed and attacking the spear's wielder. While it is more of a niche weapon with limited appeal, many professional scouts and hunters appreciate the deadly simplicity of the Huntsman and the challenge of hunting untamed beasts in ways similar to their ancient forebears. 

[P]The vibrospear requires two hands to wield.

      [H3]Mk. VIII Vibrosaw[h3]

Creel Wood Logging Corporation is a small, privately owned logging concern founded solely for the harvesting the of the highly sought-after Greel trees from the third and fourth planets of the PH System. Greels are hardy, ancient trees that produce an extremely dense, deep-crimson hardwood. Thanks to the resilience of the trees and the difficulty of harvesting them, GWLC developed special tools to aid in logging and processing. Working closely with a number of precision industrial toolmakers from the Corporate Sector, GWLC produced a line of saws, heavy equipment, specialized heavy-lift speedertrucks, and other assorted logging machinery for their personal use, and eventually they sold them to the general public. Marketed mainly to industrial logging concerns, many of these tools are also used in the surveying and exploration of newly discovered planets, especially those with dense and thorny flora. One of the more common GWLC tools is the Mk. VIII Vibrosaw. 

[P]Loud and extremely challenging to use, the Mk. VIII is a heavy vibrosaw that can cut through the toughest undergrowth or fell the tallest trees. They are heavy, awkward brutes that, in the hands of the inexperienced or inattentive, can cause more damage to the user than to the surrounding flora. The Mk. VIII consists of a blocky chassis containing the saw's controls, two SureGrip handles, a power pack, a drive motor, and a vibrofield generator. The blade mounted to the front of the chassis is long and thin, ringed by a rotating, high-speed, diamond-toothed chain whose already impressive cutting ability is further augmented by a powerful vibrofield. Although not designed as such, the Mk. VIII can be used as a weapon in an emergency, its blade slicing through flesh and bone as easily as root and branch. Caution must be used when doing so, however, as even the slightest miscalculation or misstep can result in the user receiving gruesome injuries from his own saw.

[P]If the user generates [DE] when using the Mk. VIII as a weapon, he hits himself with the attack instead of his target (even if the attack would normally miss). The Mk. VIII requires two hands to use.

While the standard penetrator ammunition offered with the Model 38 works well in most situations, sometimes a shooter needs a little extra punch to fell his prey. To this end, Czerka offers the Detonator Round for use with the Model 38. Instead of the coated penetrator bullet, Detonator Rounds have a metal coated shaped charge bullet that explodes on contact with its target. When used with the Model 38. these rounds have the following effect on the weapon's stats: Remove the Pierce quality and add the Blast (5) quality and Knockdown quality. Detonator Rounds cost 450 credits for a box of rounds, and have a rarity of 7. If the weapon ever runs out of ammo, a new box of rounds must he purchased to reload it

      [H3]CDEF Blaster Pistol[h3]

A basic, cheap design manufactured by Corellian Arms, a subsidiary of the Corellian Engineering Corporation, the CDEF blaster pistol is the standard sidearm issued to CorSec officers. While it lacks the stopping power of many other comparable light blasters, the weapon's relatively small size, reliability, and ease of maintenance have kept it in service with CorSec since before the Clone Wars.

      [H3]Dueling Pistol[h3]

Crafted by Coronet Arms, a small weapons manufacturer known for producing high-quality blasters, these dueling pistols are almost invariably sold in pairs. Though illegal, dueling has a long history on Corellia, where honor often trumps law. Dueling pistols are virtually useless at any great range, the cohesion of their particle streams quickly dissipating, but these deadly accurate blasters are meant to be used at close range. Since a single shot is all that is permitted in a duel, the power packs only power one blast, but that shot will almost invariably be lethal.

The HL-27 is a sterling example of the superior craftsmanship of weapons produced by Coronet Arms. Favored by the well-heeled of Corellia and those who wish to carry a first-rate blaster without necessarily announcing that they are armed, the HL-27 is an excellent choice for those who prefer discretion to bellicose valor without sacrificing firepower. It is not uncommon for CorSec agents who can afford them to carry the 1-1-27 in preference to the standard CDEF blaster pistol.

      [H3]XL-2 "Flashfire" Blaster Pistol[h3]

A product of the Talus Ironworks, the XL-2 "Flashfire" is one of the flashiest blasters credits can buy, both figuratively and literally. The XL-2 is a plasma-based blaster that emits a significant amount of highly energetic particles when fired. However, the design of the focusing element disperses the beam very slightly, creating a brilliant flash when the blaster discharges. While the power output of the blaster is not particularly impressive, the flash can daze and temporarily blind an opponent, giving the wielder a slight edge in a gunfight.

Considered by many to be one of the finest production model blasters in the galaxy, the H-7 "Equalizer" possesses virtually unparalleled quality and precision. Produced in limited numbers, the Equalizer is extremely sought after in spite of its high price, and buyers often have to wait months to obtain one. High-ranking officers in the CorSec and successful freetraders carry H-7s as status symbols as well as due to their impressive firepower and accuracy.

This unassuming pistol produced by Fed-Dub Protective Services Inc. provides citizens of the double worlds with a last-ditch punch for personal protection. The Spukami is designed for close-quarters combat only, and while it hits hard, it also loses accuracy quickly at any kind of range. 

[P]When firing the Spukami at short range (or longer), the weapon gains the Inaccurate 1 quality (it does not gain this quality when fired at an engaged target). Add [SE] to a character's Perception check when attempting to find a holdout pistol on a person's body.

Produced by Corellian Arms, the CR-2 heavy blaster pistol is a somewhat outdated weapon. Though no longer in production, the CR-2 is still used by several police and security forces throughout the galaxy. Firing a focused beam of charged plasma, the CR-2 is reliable and easy to maintain. The blaster is usually fitted with a second under-barrel forearm grip to increase its firing stability.

The Corellian Arms SKZ Sporting Blaster is a popular civilian weapon used for hunting and self-defense. A relatively compact and simple design that has been in production for centuries, the SKZ doesn't have the power of military grade blaster rifles, but has good range and is capable of bringing down all but the largest game. The SKZ comes with a rail system for easily adding attachments and can be quickly broken down into three parts for transport in a small case.

Marketed by Talus Ironworks as the ASP-9, this pistol is more commonly known as the Vrelt, after a vicious rodent native to the Corellian System. A cheap, simple design, the ASP-9 fires comparatively small rounds in rapid bursts. Though notoriously inaccurate, the weapon's ability to unleash a hail of lead and the ease with which it can be concealed make the Vrelt a favorite of thugs and criminals. It is not uncommon for bodies riddled with slugs to be found in the back alleys of the Blue Sector or the slums of Dearic.

      [H3]Mark V "Sand Panther" Hunting Rifle[h3]

Coveted by big game hunters who can afford the steep price, the Coronet Arms Mark V "Sand Panther" is a superb rifle with excellent range, accuracy, and stopping power. Like other Coronet Arms designs, the Mark V is precisely tooled, with handcrafted stocks made of golden creshik wood imported from Tralus. The rifle's exceptionally long barrel allows the weapon to be accurate, even at extreme ranges. Due to the length and caliber of the barrel, the Mark V is somewhat cumbersome and has a considerable recoil when fired, which is somewhat dampened by a pneumatic recoil buffer built in to the rifle's firing mechanism.

A peculiar weapon, the Selonian shard shooter is a relatively compact slugthrower that fires razor-sharp crystalline ammunition. Instead of a chemical propellant, the shard shooter uses a sophisticated electromagnetic propulsion system to accelerate the shards down its barrel at tremendous velocity. The weapon fires in bursts, unleashing a storm of lethal shards at its target, capable of penetrating modern armor and the shredding flesh and bone beneath. Since this weapon is only produced on Selonia, finding the shard ammunition outside of the Corellian System is next to impossible.

    <Description>
      [H3]Corellian Compound Bow[h3]

A massive bow made of composite materials, the compound bow uses a system of cams and cables to lever the arms and reduce the draw weight when fully drawn, allowing for longer, more accurate aiming. This is almost a necessity for Corellian bows, since their draw weights tend to be in the range of 55 to 85 kilograms. Some Corellians consider drawing a bow a true test of a man's strength, and bows with draw weights of less than 50 kilograms are general considered children's models. The impressive tension stored in a Corellian compound bow allows the broadhead arrows fired from one to deliver a tremendous amount of kinetic force. 

[P]Regular arrows are cheap to replace; if the GM needs to set a price he can charge I credit per arrow. These bows can also be used to fire special explosive tipped or stun arrows instead of the normal broad-head arrows. If these arrows are used, use the secondary profile given on [B]Table 3-1[b].

    <Description>
      [H3]Corellian Compound Bow (Stun)[h3]

A massive bow made of composite materials, the compound bow uses a system of cams and cables to lever the arms and reduce the draw weight when fully drawn, allowing for longer, more accurate aiming. This is almost a necessity for Corellian bows, since their draw weights tend to be in the range of 55 to 85 kilograms. Some Corellians consider drawing a bow a true test of a man's strength, and bows with draw weights of less than 50 kilograms are general considered children's models. The impressive tension stored in a Corellian compound bow allows the broadhead arrows fired from one to deliver a tremendous amount of kinetic force. 

[P]Regular arrows are cheap to replace; if the GM needs to set a price he can charge I credit per arrow. These bows can also be used to fire special explosive tipped or stun arrows instead of the normal broad-head arrows. If these arrows are used, use the secondary profile given on [B]Table 3-1[b].

      [H3]Styanax Lance[h3]

A large, vicious harpoon gun, the styanax lance has been used by countless generations of stabmen to hunt the ferocious sea serpents that haunt the stormy Sea of Jarad on Tralus. Mounted at the bows of their nagaks (the wide-hulled, oar-powered boats used by the human and Selonian seafarers of Tralus), the styanax lance is a meter-and-a-half long harpoon with a sharp, barbed durasteel tip designed to penetrate the armored scales and tough skin of the styanax. Thrown by the strong arms of the stabmen, the lance is attached to a stout flexisteel cable about two hundred meters long, which the stabmen use to haul in their prey. Rarely seen outside of Tralus, the styanax lance is occasionally used by off-world big game hunters on safari to bring down particularly large beasts, such as giant gundarks or bull rancors.

Traditionally granted to Corellian naval officers upon being promoted from ensign or sub-lieutenant to full lieutenant, the Corellian cutlass is a relatively short, broad saber with a solid hand guard. While generally considered little more than ornamental blade, the weight and craftsmanship of the cutlass makes it an effective weapon in close combat. Some Corellian free-traders who previously served in the navy retain their cutlasses and continue to wear them.

The standard beamdrill used by Corellia Mining Corporation, the J-7b has been in service since before the Clone Wars. Using intense pulses of plasma to strip away rock, the beamdrill can carve through virtually anything, including armor. While not intended to be a weapon, the cumbersome beamdrill can be extremely lethal if used as a makeshift weapon, and has even seen use by pirates to breach the hulls and bulkheads of their prey vessels.

Used almost exclusively by the Drall constabulary, the flashstick is a non-lethal weapon used to subdue criminals and other undesirables. A small metal baton, the flashstick emits a brilliant, coruscating flash of light when striking a target, which is capable of temporarily blinding and stunning its mark. The flashstick is particularly effective against Drall, Defel, Selonians, and Sullustans, whose eyes are sensitive to light; the weapon has virtually no effect on species who don't rely on visual senses, such as the blind Miraluka and the troglodytic Cthon.

      [H3]Selonian Glaive[h3]

Individually crafted by Selonian females as a rite of passage, the Selonian glaive is a unique work of art as much as it is a weapon. At maturity, a female is expected to collect the materials need to create the glaive herself, and wielding the weapon in battle is a mark of worth among the Selonians. A heavy wooden pole, typically about two meters in length, forms the body of the weapon, with a large, razor-sharp obsidian blade attached to one end and obsidian hooks and barbs affixed to the other end. A peculiar mineral in Selonian obsidian makes the volcanic glass more stable and far less brittle than normal, giving it unusual strength and toughness, as well as a distinctive iridescent quality. The edge of the glaive's blade is mere nanometers thick, allowing it to slice through armor, flesh, and bone with contemptuous ease.

The standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship. Preferred over blaster cannons for their damage and accuracy, laser cannons can be paired in batteries or mounted separately. Light and medium laser cannons are often found on starfighters and freighters. Heavy laser cannons are mounted to capital ships as secondary weapons to deal with smaller ships. Lasers are also often mounted to military ground vehicles.

Representative of blaster pistols across the galaxy, the Model 44 is a reliable pistol that is more than adequate for most situations. Merr-Sonn's Model 44 is well-suited to use aboard starships or in technological facilities, as it is less likely to damage vital systems than a more powerful blaster rifle, yet strong enough to penetrate laminate armor on a direct hit. As such, it is often used as a sidearm by mercenaries, security forces, and pirates.

      [H3]Model 80 Blaster Pistol[h3]

The Model 80 from Merr-Sonn Munitions is a rugged and dependable blaster pistol that many mercenaries tend to use as their primary weapon. It lacks the stopping power of a heavy blaster pistol, but still fires powerful energy bolts that can do a great deal of damage to their target. The weapon gains this stopping power at the expense of weight and portability. A bulky blaster, the Model 80 is a bit too heavy for a soldier to carry as a backup weapon and the various protuberances and the secondary scope makes it hard to draw quickly in a firefight. 

[P]The time taken to draw, holster, stow, or otherwise access this weapon cannot be reduced by talents, gear, or any other means.

For those who operate on the edge of the law, firepower can be a valuable commodity. The Merr-Sonn Munitions IR-5 "Intimidator" can provide that in spades. Though slightly less powerful than most comparably-sized blaster pistols, the IR-5 has a rate of fire equivalent to that of a repeating blaster, a feature that earned the Intimidator its nickname. Restricted throughout the Corellian Sector, the IR-5 can nonetheless be found on the hip of many fringers who call Corellia home.

      [H3]DL-7h Heavy Blaster Pistol[h3]

These weighty, deadly pistols are a favorite of both smugglers and mercenaries. Powerful enough to punch straight through laminate armor, the DL-7H's reputation is well-deserved. In fact, the weapon packs so much power into a pistol that many worlds with otherwise lax blaster regulations have outlawed it. In order to boost damage, the DL-7H draws heavily from its power cell, draining it quickly. Another effect of the weapon's unique power draw is its lack of a stun setting. 

[P]The GM may spend [TH][TH] to cause a Player Character's DL-7H to run out of ammo.

      [H3]ACP Array Gun[h3]

A favorite weapon of pirates, the somewhat crude-looking Arakyd Accelerated Charged Particle Array Gun is a short-range blaster useful for clearing the halls and corridors of starships. With a specialized galven coil and prismatic crystal array at the end of the actuating module, blasts from an ACP Array split into a wide spray pattern on exiting the barrel. Though only effective at short ranges, in the narrow passageways and closed spaces of a starship, these weapons can be devastating and are frequently employed by shock troops and pirates during boarding actions.

      [H3]DH-X Heavy Blaster Rifle[h3]

The DH-X from BlasTech is a powerful weapon favored by mercenary soldiers with an appreciation for heavy weaponry. Amongst the largest heavy blaster rifles manufactured by BlasTech, the DH-X can drop most targets with a single shot. However, the power increase means a slower rate of fire. As such, the DH-X fills an important niche between blaster rifles and repeating blasters.

    <Description>
      [H3]OK-98 Blaster Carbine[h3]

The OK-98 is unique in that the weapon features slots for two power packs. An onboard computer automatically switches to the second power pack once the first is depleted, so that a user reloads half as frequently as with a typical blaster. Because blasters require such infrequent reloading in the first place, this feature proved to be of secondary concern to most buyers, who were put off by the weapon's extra weight in comparison to similarly sized carbines. As a result, the OK-98 sold poorly and SoroSuub discontinued production of the model after only six years. The weapon has since found new life on the black market thanks to an illegal modification that allows it to draw from both packs simultaneously. This does enhance the damage output of the weapon, but also wears out several components in a comparably short time. The modification is fairly sensitive, and a poorly-modified weapon can be quite dangerous to the user. 

[P]A character using an OK-98 can ignore the first "out of ammo" [DE] result during a combat, just as with an extra power pack, without expending a maneuver. 
A modified OK-98 (requiring an [B]Easy ([DI]) Mechanics check[b]) increases weapon damage by 2, replacing the option to ignore the first "out of ammo" result. The GM can spend [DE] to have a modified OK-98 catastrophically overheat and explode, inflicting one hit from the weapon (dealing base damage) on the user and destroying the weapon after the attack has been resolved.

      [H3]SE-14r Light Repeating Blaster[h3]

The BlasTech SE-14r, also known as the Imperial repeating pistol, combines the portability and ease of use of a blaster pistol with a high rate of fire. These weapons are carried as side arms by some Imperial officers (including some stormtrooper commanders) and pilots. Manufactured specifically for Imperial forces, some of these weapons inevitably find their way onto the black market, where they fetch a high price. 

[P]Due to its high rate of fire, the SE-14r is more likely to run out of ammo during an extended firelight or series of engagements. The GM may spend [TH][TH][TH] to cause a character's SE-14r to run out of ammo.

    <Description>
      [H3]VX "Sidewinder" Repeating Blaster[h3]

Unlike other repeating blasters, the SoroSuub VX achieves its high rate of fire through the use of five rotating barrels. Each barrel features its own actuating blaster module, galven coil, and crystal housing, distributing wear and preventing excessive buildup of heat on any one barrel. Though designed for use with its included bipod (see page 188 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rules), a wielder with sufficient strength can carry and even fire the weapon on the move, albeit invariably with reduced accuracy. Users who intend to wield the VX in this way often attach a shoulder strap, although even then the weapon requires two hands to wield.

      [H3]HOB Heavy Repeating Blaster[h3]

The High-Output Repeating Blaster from SoroSuub is a powerful and reliable weapon. Rarely seen outside of military forces, the HOB typically requires a crew of two to operate as an emplaced weapon, though it is possible for an individual of exceptional strength to carry the weapon. Remarkably, despite its high rate of fire and energy draw, the HOB's robust, simple construction makes somewhat easier to repair in the field, and it is amazingly easy to set up and take down. The cost of this weapon includes a tripod such as that found on page 193 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rules. Setting up this tripod weapon requires the crew to spend two preparation maneuvers, plus two more for the tripod. 

[P]Mechanics Checks to repair a HOB gain [BO].

      [H3]FYR Assault Carbine[h3]

This slugthrower offering from a relatively obscure manufacturer is notable for its high rate of fire. While certainly an effective weapon, its biggest advantage is perhaps also its greatest downfall, as the automatic weapon's high fire rate highlights the problems of ammunition capacity inherent in all slugthrower weapons. In order to make use of the weapon during any sort of extended engagement or operation, the user must weigh himself down with large quantities of ammunition, and reload often. 

The GM may spend [TH][TH] to cause a PC's assault carbine to run out of ammo.

      [H3]Model C "Fiver" Pistol[h3]

The Xet Model C incorporates a five-round internal cylinder magazine. Even by the standards of slugthrowers, this weapon is time-consuming to reload, as each high-caliber round must be inserted individually. Yet despite its limitations, the Model C is popular with some Hired Guns who find an aesthetic pleasure in its unusual operation. It must be said that the Model C is a dangerous weapon, at least for a slugthrower, with high stopping power due to its large-bore chamber. However, a combatant wielding a Model C must make every shot count if he hopes to triumph over an enemy with a more sophisticated weapon. Most consider this weapon a curiosity at best, a museum piece at worst.

This weapon is also about twice the size and weight of an ordinary flame projector, and as such is usually vehicle-mounted. However, individuals with the strength to wield it find few weapons as deadly and terrifying to their foes as a CZ-28 Flamestrike.

    <Description>
      [H3]FC1 Flechette Launcher (Anti-Infantry)[h3]

The FC1 is representative of most shoulder-braced flechette launchers. This bulky, box-shaped launcher holds four canister tubes, and can fire either anti-personnel or anti-vehicle flechettes. The weapon fires small missiles designed to detonate close to their target, then shred it with numerous durasteel darts. The standard anti-infantry canister releases hundreds of small flechettes over a wide area, ideal for taking down groups of enemies. Anti-vehicle rounds feature a much smaller number, usually fewer than a dozen, of significantly larger and heavier darts capable of shearing straight through ten centimeters of durasteel plating. The shaped charge of an anti-vehicle cartridge focuses the projectiles over a much smaller area, and is ideal for bringing down repulsorcraft or other light vehicles (especially since the armor-penetrating darts tend to slice through the thick outer armor then bounce around inside the hull, tearing up vital components). 

[P]Before firing the FC1, the firer must use the scope's built-in range finder to program a detonation range approximately 10 meters in front of the target for ideal dispersal of flechettes. This guarantees he hits the target with the blast. The anti-vehicle rounds of a flechette launcher have a much narrower spread, making them highly inaccurate against small targets. When used against targets of silhouette 1 or smaller and firing anti-vehicle rounds, the weapon gains the Inaccurate 3 quality. 

[P]An FC1 may be loaded with anti-personnel or anti-vehicle rounds, and can fire a total of four shots. Some mercenaries tend to load the FC1 with a mix of both, so that they can respond to any situation. In this case, the character should note what his weapon is loaded with, and use the appropriate profile with each shot. He still has to track total shots as per the Limited Ammo quality.

      [H3]Z50 Grenade Launcher[h3]

The Z50 from Malaxan Firepower Incorporated is a powerful weapon that can be readily handled by a single user. A grenade launcher fires explosive projectiles that have power equivalent to hand grenades. While less powerful and without the firing options of a missile tube, the Z50 is also much lighter and can be carried more easily. The grenades are also smaller, allowing smaller weapons to carry the same or more shots. 

[P]The listed price does not include ammunition. Grenades for a grenade launcher cost the same as equivalent hand grenades, though many merchants offer a 50 percent discount on cases of six. The weapon can fire any grenade, although the grenade launcher projectiles are different than hand grenades (grenade launcher projectiles also cannot be thrown, they must be fired from the grenade launcher). The character should specify what type of grenades he wants when purchasing them. The listed profile for the grenade launcher represents the weapon loaded with standard frag grenades (see the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core,Rulebook, page 160).

      [H3]D-24 Inferno Grenade[h3]

Restricted to military use or banned entirely on most worlds, the D-24 Inferno Grenade detonates in a fiery blast that inflicts terrible wounds and collateral damage. The extreme heat of the blast easily ignites flammable materials in the vicinity, causing unpredictable destruction far past the grenade's initial use. An inferno grenade causes chaos and panic amongst targets. The indiscriminate and fearsome nature of the weapon ensures only the most ruthless mercenaries and killers employ it.

      [H3]G2 Concussion Grenade[h3]

Concussion grenades are powerful hand-held bombs that release a debilitating shock wave over the surrounding area. The detonation of a concussion grenade is strong enough to maim or even kill an unarmored target, while the shock wave released can incapacitate any foes within the grenade's blast radius. Some concussion grenades are designed to simply kill, while others focus on incapacitation. The G2 is an example of the latter, designed to disorient any foes it does not eliminate. 

[P]If the user activates a concussion grenade's Disorient quality, the Disorient quality affects all characters at short range from the target (even if they are not damaged by the weapon).

The detonation of an ion grenade is much like the blast of an ion gun. The advantage of an ion grenade is that all droids caught in the blast radius are affected, allowing the user to disable multiple mechanical targets at once. Great care must be taken in the vicinity of important technology. Many starship captains refuse to allow ion grenades aboard their vessel, even when providing transport to heavily armed mercenaries.

      [H3]NOVA40 Plasma Grenade[h3]

A plasma grenade contains a store of blaster gas comparable to the load of a blaster pistol. When primed, an XCiter unit converts the gas to a highly energetic state. After three to sixty seconds, as selected by the user, the grenade activates the gas with a laser charge, detonating in highly explosive fashion. The resulting explosion is very similar in appearance and effect to a blaster bolt, but more powerful than even a heavy blaster and dispersed over a much larger area.

      [H3]Mk.4 Heavy Frag Grenade[h3]

Sporting a stronger detonite charge and larger surface area than other frag grenades, Golan Arms' heavy fragmentation grenade yields a consequently larger and more powerful blast, with a greater quantity of shrapnel dispersed over a wider area. Typically, only very large and physically strong individuals carry heavy frag grenades in lieu of standard models, as the increased bulk and weight is a not-inconsiderable hindrance for most users.

Like their hand-held grenade counterparts, concussion missiles unleash a powerful blast and accompanying shock wave strong enough to incapacitate or injure targets outside of the initial blast radius. Numerous varieties of concussion missiles are available from different manufacturers, with some advertised as a non-lethal countermeasure, and others as anti-armor weapons. The Golan Arms Mk.10 is an anti-personnel weapon. 

[P]If the user activates a concussion missile's Disorient quality, the Disorient quality affects all characters at short range from the target (even if they are not damaged by the weapon). If the user activates a concussion missile's Concussive quality, the Concussive quality affects all characters engaged with the target (even if they are not damaged by the weapon).

Designed for use against infantry rather than vehicles, a fragmentation missile functions much like a typical frag grenade, scattering shards of metal over a wide area, shredding tissue and shattering bone. Frag missiles are absolutely deadly to unarmored or lightly armored targets, and pose a considerable threat even to those protected by battle armor.

      [H3]SK-44 Plasma Missile[h3]

When primed, a store of high-energy gas within the plasma warhead is converted into a highly volatile plasma state. The operation of a plasma missile is actually very similar to that of a blaster, and the resulting detonation is not unlike the impact of a blaster bolt, albeit magnified tenfold. The trade-off of this weapon is that the unstable warhead detonates after a brief flight time whether it hits its target or not, making the effective range relatively short.

Combining the fury of a flame projector with the range and power of a missile, an incendiary missile is a devastating weapon capable of wiping out entire squad's of infantry in a single blast. Some Hired Guns enjoy the particularly powerful effect of an incendiary missile on their enemies' morale. Few sights are as demoralizing as that of a missile incinerating one's comrades in a single fiery instant.

      [H3]Blast Knuckles[h3]

This unusual weapon consists of a heavy, armored glove incorporating what amounts to a light blaster pistol on the back of the wearer's hand. Impact-sensitive plating across the knuckles fires the blaster when the wearer lands a punch, delivering a devastating blast. While these weapons are undeniably effective, they are also dangerous for the wielder. Despite the fact that the impact-plating supposedly also shields the user, only the very brave or very reckless embrace the idea of a blaster impact just scant centimeters from their fingers. Even the toughest fighters can only withstand repeated blaster impacts on their knuckles for so long. 

[P]When using blast knuckles, every successful hit inflicts 1 strain on the wielder (in addition to any strain suffered due to check results). Blast knuckles cannot deal damage to a target's strain threshold.

      [H3]S-1 Vamblade (Paired)[h3]

Falling somewhere between brass knuckles and a sword, vamblades are dagger-length blades extending from durasteel vambraces, which provide a degree of protection to the wielder's forearms in a knife fight, as well as mounting the blade itself. The S-1 from Prax Arms includes a magnetic locking mechanism, allowing the user to retract or extend the blade with a simple flick of his wrist. When retracted, the blade can easily be hidden under a heavy coat, robe, or similar garb, making these weapons a favorite of assassins. 

[P]Wrist blades are designed to be worn as a pair, and open up a whole range of combat options when used thus by a properly-trained fighter. When used as a pair, wrist blades gain the Sunder and Accurate 1 weapon qualities. (This applies even if they are not used with two weapon combat rules to gain an additional hit.) Vamblades cannot deal damage to a target's strain threshold.

Falling somewhere between brass knuckles and a sword, vamblades are dagger-length blades extending from durasteel vambraces, which provide a degree of protection to the wielder's forearms in a knife fight, as well as mounting the blade itself. The S-1 from Prax Arms includes a magnetic locking mechanism, allowing the user to retract or extend the blade with a simple flick of his wrist. When retracted, the blade can easily be hidden under a heavy coat, robe, or similar garb, making these weapons a favorite of assassins. 

[P]Wrist blades are designed to be worn as a pair, and open up a whole range of combat options when used thus by a properly-trained fighter. When used as a pair, wrist blades gain the Sunder and Accurate 1 weapon qualities. (This applies even if they are not used with two weapon combat rules to gain an additional hit.) Vamblades cannot deal damage to a target's strain threshold.

      [H3]Vibroknucklers[h3]

For those who like to let their fists do the talking, a set of vibroknucklers can ensure the last word. Worn like the more common brass knuckles, a small blade running the length of the wearer's knuckles vibrates at an ultrasonic rate when the user clenches his fist. Without changing his fighting style, a brawler equipped with vibroknucklers can easily inflict horrific and fatal wounds with simple punches. 

[P]Add [SE] to attempts to locate vibroknucklers concealed about an individual's body. Vibroknucklers cannot deal damage to a target's strain threshold.

The traditional melee weapon of the Wookiees, a Ryyk blade is a heavy, single-edged sword useful for clearing away both brush and enemies in the thick jungles of Kashyyyk. Though the weapon has changed little over the millennia, many Wookiees prefer the weapon of their ancestors to more technologically-advanced vibro-weapons. 
[P]The damage from the Superior quality is included in the profile.

      [H3]Model 7 Therm-Ax[h3]

Though similar in appearance to a vibro-ax, the SoroSuub Model 7 operates on very different principles. The ax head is crafted from a superconductive durasteel alloy, with thermal coils concealed just beneath the surface, running to the power supply located under the blade. When activated, the ax blade quickly reaches temperatures in excess of 500 degrees. Even a glancing blow or near miss can ignite flammable materials, while a direct hit can incinerate flesh. Those wielding the weapon usually don heat-resistant garb, as their proximity to the blade can otherwise be quite unpleasant. 

[P]A therm-ax requires two hands to wield.

The Czerka model VX is similar to other vibroswords, but with a much longer, heavier blade and an extended hilt accommodating a two-handed grip. Many skilled swordsmen favor the "Czerhander," which rivals a vibro-ax for hitting power, while granting the wielder greater control. The well-balanced blade allows for effective parrying, despite its size and weight.

      [H3]Baradium Charge[h3]

Baradium is one of the most dangerous and volatile explosives used in demolitions. The synthetic mineral is best known for being used in thermal detonators. However, baradium can be detonated independently, although these devices are inevitably highly volatile. A large enough baradium charge can level a small town, and incorrectly constructing one can prove to be the brief and fiery end to a demolitionist's career. 

[P]Baradium weapons deal damage on planetary scale, but their blast radius is measured in personal scale. If the demolitionist generates [DE] when setting up the device, it detonates immediately, dealing the device's damage (base plus additional damage) to everything in the current blast radius. Anything engaged with the device when it detonates should add +50 to any subsequent critical injury or critical hit rolls.

      [H3]Detonite Charge[h3]

Detonite is a powerful explosive used for demolitions work—and for sabotage. A detonite charge is not a weapon per se, and is not intended for use in combat situations. However, detonite charges are often used to set traps, and some sentients mine the site of an expected confrontation to gain the advantage. Detonite requires a trigger mechanism to set off, and each charge comes with a simple trigger that can be detonated via comlink or timer (times can be from one hour to one second).

      [H3]Proton Grenade[h3]

Frequently used for demolitions work and in boarding actions, proton grenades are extremely powerful devices that rely on the same technology as the warheads of proton torpedoes, albeit on a much smaller scale. Nevertheless, proton grenades are exceeded only by thermal detonators for sheer destructive power in a hand-held package. Proton grenades feature a magnetic clamp and directed charge, so that they are better suited to breaching bulkheads or destroying facilities than as anti-personnel weapons. The devices are also highly prized in demolitions work because of the sympathetic qualities of the blast. Multiple grenades correctly linked together produce a much more powerful blast than each grenade separately. 

[P]When setting up an explosive device using proton grenades, the second grenade adds +20 damage, the third adds +30, the fourth adds +40, and the fifth adds +50, for a total of 150 damage for five grenades. After the fifth grenade, additional grenades do not add additional damage, but do increase the blast range by one range band per additional grenade.

This decoy missile, once launched, broadcasts an electromagnetic signature that draws off enemy missiles. To fire a decoy, make an [B]Easy ([DI]) Computers check[b]. If successful, any attacks against the ship firing the decoy using weapons with the Guided quality upgrade their difficulty by one (plus an additional upgrade for every additional [AD][AD]) while the decoy is active (one round per Vf). If a weapon with the Guided quality misses the target ship but generates [AD][AD][AD] or [TR], they hit the decoy instead; ending the effect.

This countermeasure follows but does not attempt to impact the target vehicle. Instead, it fires a jamming beam at the vehicle (see Jamming Beam, below) If the initial combat check is successful, the missile follows the target at close range for one round per [SU]. The missile adds [SE][SE] to the target's [B]Gunnery, Piloting, and Computers checks[b] (when the pilot is scanning with sensors). The missile's limited fuel means it self-destructs after 3 rounds. The missile can be shot down, but it has a silhouette of 1. Any damage destroys it.

      [H3]Mini-Missile Pack[h3]

The missile bank launcher is a self-contained missile battery that holds eight to ten missiles designed to fire as a group or cluster. The bank fires half of its payload at a time. The missiles or rockets are designed to fire in a spread pattern. They depend on quantity far more than the accuracy of the individual weapons. The Arakyd Missile Pack typically faces a specific firing arc, selected at the time of installation. A turret-mounted variation requires an additional hard point. Standard missile banks may be mounted to vehicles of silhouette 2 or greater. Mini-missile variants may be mounted to a vehicle of silhouette 2.

It may carry a variety of missile types (see [B]Table 2-8: Specialized Missiles and Rockets for Vehicles[b]), which are typically about a half-meter or less in length. The tube faces a single firing arc, though a turret mount is also available. It may be installed on any non-starship vehicle of silhouette size 2 or greater.

      [H3]Entrenching Tool (Improvised)[h3]

In appearance and function, this useful tool is little more than a small shovel or spade, though common military versions feature a collapsible or foldable shaft for compact storage. Soldiers across the galaxy use this ubiquitous device to dig latrines, foxholes, and other makeshift entrenchments, and occasionally to neutralize alien fauna. Though the design seems simple, the edge of an entrenching tool is razor-sharp and made from hardened durasteel, making it a dangerous weapon. 

[P]Besides allowing the user to dig holes and entrenchments, the Imperial Army Entrenching Tool counts as a small improvised weapon that deals +2 damage instead of + 1, has a Crit Rating of 4, and does not break due to [DE] or [TH].

A tactical tractor beam is a relatively small and low powered tractor beam system. While not strong enough to control an enemy craft's movement while it is able to maneuver, the tactical tractor beam can slow it down, reduce its maneuverability and disrupt its attacks. Some pilots find these devices provide an invaluable edge in dogfighting, but others believe the distraction they cause is more trouble than benefit.

[P]The BlasTech Industries Relby-k23 blaster pistol is a sidearm banned from civilian purchase and used by agents of the Galactic Empire. It is known for its low refraction index, which results in minimal beam dispersion when the blaster is fired. The beam produced by this blaster pistol inflicts excruciating pain upon beings who have the misfortune of being hit by it. The only known drawback of the Relby-k23 is its faulty safety.

      [H3]Model Q4 Quickfire[h3]

Touted as a revolution in light blaster design, Merr-Sonn's Q4 Quickfire is one of the more unique hold-out blasters on the market today. Instead of the typical gas chamber and energy cell power supply, the Q4 possesses an integral rechargeable power pack that provides more stopping power and a higher cyclic rate of fire than other holdouts. The trade-off for this extra power is the fact that the power pack must be recharged instead of easily replaced (a process that takes ten minutes), as well as the weapon's dismal performance at anything farther than short range. 

[P]Add [SE] to a character's Perception checks when attempting to find a 04 Quickfire on a person's body. If this weapon runs out of ammo due to a [DE] result, it may not be reloaded by Extra Reloads, the Spare Clip talent, or other means.

      [H3]SWE/2 Sonic Rifle[h3]

Known primarily for their finely designed skiffs and robust security systems, Telex-Delcor also produces a line of reliable and easy-to-use non-lethal riot control devices. One of their more unique offerings is the SWE/2 Sonic Rifle. A refinement of the SWE/1 Sonic Suppressor released during the Clone Wars, the SWE/2 is a long-barrelled firearm designed to incapacitate even the toughest, most persistent malcontent. Using a powerful acoustic generator, the SWE/2 fires a concentrated beam of sound waves similar in power and performance to the particle beam packets fired by blasters. When used on sentient beings, this weapon affects the targets' hearing and sense of balance, staggering the targets and shorting out their fine motor centers. Similar to its Clone Wars-era predecessor, the sonic blast generated by the SWE/2 cannot be parried or disrupted by a lightsaber; a very attractive feature during the end of the Clone Wars, but of limited usefulness today.

    <Description>
      [H3]R-88 Supressor Riot Rifle[h3]

Produced by the non-lethal weapons division of Merr-Sonn Munitions, the R-88 is one of the most common riot control weapons in the galaxy. First released decades before the Clone Wars, the R-88 is similar in design and operation to the rare and expensive Stokhli Spray Stick. These long arms resemble bulky blaster rifles with two large cylinders slung beneath the barrel. The cylinders are loaded with a highly effective liquid nerve agent called Brix-C Stun Fluid, which is synthesized by Merr-Sonn. When fired, the Suppressor shoots a high velocity, concentrated stream of Brix-C that quickly aerosolizes as it travels. Effective at short and medium ranges, the stun fluid deals its damage either through inhalation or skin contact and causes nausea, impaired vision, difficulty breathing, burning pain, and unconsciousness. 

[P]While highly effective against sudden riots or other disturbances, the stun fluid is easily countered by breath masks and heavy clothing. This makes it less effective against determined, well organized targets expecting such weapons. At the GM's discretion, characters wearing breathing gear or sealed armor may take no damage or suffer no effects from the Suppressor.

      [H3]Stokhli Spray Stick[h3]

Designed ages ago by the Stokhli, a non-human nomadic race from the Inner Rim world of Manress, these long-range non-lethal weapons are perfect for crowd control and riot suppression. Used primarily by the Stokhli to hunt the large, incredibly aggressive megafauna of their homeworld, the Spray Stick is a meter long metal rod with a tightly focused spray nozzle at one end and a stun pad equipped butt-stock at the other. Fired from the shoulder like a blaster rifle, these weapons shoot a highly concentrated spraynet mist. The mist condenses into a liquid, then into a solid web while in flight, enveloping and immobilizing its target. In addition, as the net envelops its target, it delivers a powerful electrical charge. Extremely rare and finely made, each Stokhli Spray Stick comes equipped with an accurate range finder and a fine aerosol control system that allows the user to more easily hit targets at long range. Despite their rarity and steep price, Stokhli Spray Sticks are always in demand. 
[P]When using the stun pad on the butt-stock, the Stokhli Spray Stick can be used as a melee weapon with the following profile (Skill Melee; Damage +2; Critical —; Range [Engaged Inaccurate 1, Stun Damage).

      [H3]Tangle Gun[h3]

Another non-lethal offering from Merr-Sonn, the Tangle Gun 7 is the latest word in crowd control weaponry. The Tangle Gun 7 is a carbine-sized rifle with a short, wide-mouthed barrel and polycarbonate furniture that is light and easy to handle. The weapon fires a small pellet of naorstrachem, a sticky and extremely flexible atmosphere-reactive synthetic memory material. Encased in a shell that falls away once the pellet is fired, the pellet explosively expands into a broad, fast moving net upon contact with atmosphere. Once the net makes contact with a target, the being's body heat causes the net to quickly contract, immobilizing him completely. Once entangled, the target must be cut from the webbing. While the Tangle Gun 7 is advertised as non-lethal, occasionally the net tightens so quickly and with such force that it causes lasting harm.

      [H3]Backhand Shock Gloves[h3]

Produced by Corellian Personal Defense and marketed toward bodyguards, security forces, and law enforcement, the Backhand series is one of the most powerful types of shock glove on the market. Using an advanced kinetic energy reclamation system to power its high-output circuitry, a pair of Backhand shock gloves gives an individual the power and versatility of a stun baton in a wearable glove. However, due to their power requirements and the nature of their charging system (which uses the movements of their wearer to charge powerful capacitors), these gloves are slow to recharge. 

[P]This weapon has the Slow-Firing 1 rule, meaning it can only be used once every other round. This means that while a character may still make Brawl attacks when this weapon is "recharging" he does so without any benefits from the weapon—he simply makes an unarmed melee attack.

      [H3]Riot Shield[h3]

Carried throughout the galaxy by law enforcement officers responding to riots and violent protests, riot shields are a symbol of faceless authority and, occasionally, oppression. The Actiw 1 by Drearian Defense is one of the most common models available in the Outer Rim. Worn strapped to an officer's non-dominant forearm, a riot shield averages around a meter long and nearly as wide, providing almost complete cover for a kneeling or crouching officer. They are constructed from a variety of materials. The shields are typically shaped in such a way as to help deflect incoming thrown objects and stand up to sustained fire from nearly any sidearm, although anything more powerful than a heavy blaster makes short work of a riot shield and the officer behind it. In addition to their obvious protective qualities, riot shields can be used as improvised, somewhat awkward melee weapons, allowing an officer to push and bash his way through a crowd if need be. 

[P]Riot shields require one hand to wield, and so can only be used with pistols and one-handed melee weapons. Some riot shields incorporate a slot or mag-lock to allow the user to support a Ranged (Heavy) weapon with the shield itself (firing the weapon one-handed while wielding the riot shield in the other hand). A riot shield with this feature costs an additional 100 credits and has no hard points. Firing a rifle locked to the shield in this way is somewhat cumbersome, and adds [SE] to combat checks with both weapons.

      [H3]Thunderbolt Shock Prod[h3]

A particularly brutal weapon used to herd thick skinned creatures and, on occasion, sentient beings, the Thunderbolt Shock Prod produced by SoroSuub is a weapon with a mixed reputation throughout the galaxy. At once the symbol of bucolic agricultural life and brutally oppressive regimes, the Thunderbolt consists of a solid alloy staff nearly two meters long. At one end is a heavily insulated, two-handed grip and at the other is a series of sharp prongs. The prongs aren't the main threat posed by these weapons, however. Rather, it is the powerful electrical shock generated by them. Able to produce an electrical arc powerful enough to tame a krayt dragon, the Thunderbolt is popular among planetary security forces and slavers, and judicious use of these weapons by riot police can disperse a violent crowd in minutes. The effects of the noise and the crippling pain from the shock quickly incapacitate even the most determined rioters, and these weapons are infamous throughout the galaxy.

Produced by Xana Exotic Arms, the MSW-9 is a small, easily concealable blade popular among professionals, politicians, and entertainers. Built to resemble a datapad stylus, the MSW-9 is light, inconspicuous, and easily overlooked by even the most zealous and dedicated search. 

[P]Due to their inherent fragility, any combat check made while wielding one of these blades that generates either [TH][TH] or [DE] damages the weapon by one step as if struck by a weapon with the Sunder quality. Add [SE] to a character's Perception check when attempting to find a molecular stiletto on a person's body.

      [H3]Stun Baton[h3]

Resembling a typical police truncheon, the Z2 by Merr-Sonn packs an extra, often completely unexpected punch in the form of a concentrated stun blast. Carried by riot police and criminal enforcers alike on countless planets, the Z2 is a one-handed blunt weapon built from heavily reinforced polymers with conductive alloy striking surfaces. When used against organic beings, the Z2 releases a burst of stun energy that can quickly and effectively reduce a malcontent to unconsciousness. While not commonly used by the Empire, who prefer a more direct and punitive form of policing, stun batons are common in the Outer Rim where law enforcement officers prefer non-lethal methods of dealing with the people they serve and protect.

Named after the legendary hero Boonta the Hutt, who allegedly carried a similar weapon, these specialized holdout blasters typically appear to be nothing more than ornate and ostentatious pieces of jewelry. Custom-made to the taste of individual Hutts, these garish blasters pack enough firepower to ensure that any would-be assassin who gets past the wearer's bodyguards does not live long enough to remain a threat. Some of these weapons are treasured family heirlooms, passed down from one Hutt to another for many generations. 

[P]Add [SE] to Perception checks to find a Boonta Blaster on a wearer's body. Remove [SE] from the wearer's Deception checks to explain away the weapon as purely ornamental or otherwise non-threatening.

      [H3]Greff-Timms ATA Pulse-Wave Blaster[h3]

These ancient weapons were state-of-the-art thousands of years ago, prior to the development of the modern blaster. Operating on the same basic principle as a blaster, the pulse-wave blaster fires a short beam of intense energy at its target. However, this energy tends to dissipate quickly, making its effective range quite short. The destabilizing molecular effect produced by these weapons is similar to that of disruptors, resulting in particularly vicious wounds. While generally considered archaic, some rogues and criminals still appreciate the pulse-wave blaster's unpleasant capacity for mayhem.

The Accelerated Charged Particle repeater gun is a medium range blaster carbine capable of laying down a tremendous field of fire. Designed prior to the Clone Wars for use in urban and close combat firefights, the weapon was deemed underpowered for general use and saw limited assignment to commandos and other specialized units. However, the ACP repeater gun has enjoyed success in the private market, particularly among criminals, who appreciate the weapon's ability to spray a small area with bolts of deadly charged particles. So popular is the ACP repeater gun among Trandoshan mercenaries and Gank killers that it is often referred to as the "Trandoshan Chopper" or "Nar Shaddaa Grinder."

Designed for use in the endless expanse of white sand deserts on Sriluur, these unusual blasters have exceptionally long barrels, some nearly two meters in length. While not the most powerful blasters available, the particularly long range of these weapons makes them ideal for hunting in the desolate wastes and for desert warfare, in which enemies can be spotted at a great distance. Though blaster lances are somewhat cumbersome, many Weequay nonetheless carry them for their ability to hit virtually anything visible under the light of Quay.

Manufactured by the Sakiyan corporation SakTek, this unusual personal weapon uses a repulsor generator to blast its target with a wave of concussive force. Employing essentially the same technology as a tractor beam, the D-29 fires an invisible ray of electromagnetic energy that violently pushes a target away, knocking down, disorienting, and stunning creatures without directly causing any serious lasting damage.

[P]The acid in the Dissuader's ammunition continues to cause damage over time. A target struck by a round from the KD-30 suffers one wound, ignoring soak, at the beginning of his turn for the next two rounds.

One of the smallest, most easily concealed weapons in the galaxy, the Prax Arms Stealth-2VX Palm Shooter fits easily in the cupped palm of a human-sized hand, making it virtually undetectable by the casual observer. While its darts themselves are not particularly lethal, the toxins contained within the darts can be quite deadly. 
[P]Each dart can be loaded with 1 dose of neuro-toxin, anesthetic, or neuroparalytic (see page 172 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rulebook) Or any other poison (such as those on page 109) the GM deems appropriate. Whenever the wielder successfully attacks a target with the weapon (whether or not he deals damage), the target also suffers the effects of being exposed to the poison. 

Add [SE][SE] to Perception checks to find a Stealth-2VX Palm Shooter on a wearer's body.

      [H3]Vodran Hunting Rifle[h3]

These rifles, usually crafted by hand in local Vodran workshops, are commonly found in the hands of skilled dianoga hunters (or occasionally in the stomachs of dianogas). While not particularly advanced, these weapons are powerful enough to kill most predators that roam the swamps of Vodran. Cunning hunters often set up a blind in the lower branches of a mangle tree and wait for a dianoga to pop its eyestalk up from the murky waters, then blind the creature with a well-aimed shot before moving in to finish it off.

    <Description>
      [H3]Tenlos L70 Acid Projector[h3]

A terrifying weapon, the Tenloss L70 Acid Projector fires a stream of xenoboric acid capable of burning through virtually any material. The inert component chemicals are contained within two separate reservoirs within the L70, only mixing as the weapon is fired at its unfortunate target. For obvious reasons, these gruesome weapons are banned in most systems. 

[P]Acid projectors operate similarly to flame projectors, spraying targets in a narrow cone. When triggering the weapon's Burn quality, the user may choose to apply it to any one target hit by the attack; this quality may be triggered multiple times, affecting a different target each time. The GM can spend [TH][TH] or [DE] to apply the weapon's Burn quality to an ally hit by the original attack. Since the burn is chemical in nature, the Burn damage cannot be stopped by rolling around on the ground or jumping into water.

    <Description>
      [H3]Poison Gas Grenade[h3]

While most would balk at using poison gas in combat, some bounty hunters and assassins use it to inspire terror in their targets. Droid bounty hunters and Gand findsmen, who are unaffected by airborne toxins, often employ poison gas grenades. They can be filled with deadly gases, such as dioxis, trion, or Fex-M3. 

[P]Poison gas grenades can be loaded with up to 1 dose of neurotoxin, anesthetic, or neuroparalytic (see page 172 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rulebook) or other poison (such as those on page 109) that the GM deems suitable. Whenever the wielder successfully attacks a target with the weapon (whether or not he deals damage), the target also suffers the effects of being exposed to the poison.

Unless used outdoors in a windy environment, the poison gas lingers for 2 rounds, affecting anyone caught in the cloud. If used in a closed, poorly ventilated space, such as a small room or narrow starship corridor, the gas lingers for 5 rounds instead. Poison gas grenades do not harm droids and other creatures that do not breathe air. Characters equipped with vacuum sealed suits, breath masks, respirators, or rebreathers are also unaffected by the poison gas.

      [H3]Arg'garok[h3]

Based on the traditional Camorrean war ax, the Arg'garok is a massive vibro-ax capable of inflicting horrific wounds. Favored by Camorrean warriors, these weapons are heavy and ungainly, measuring a meter and a half in length and requiring tremendous strength to properly wield in combat. In spite of the weapons' association with Gamorreans, Arg'garoks are highly valued as prestige weapons and can occasionally be found in the hands of Barabels or Houks in the employ of the Hutt kajidics—more physical and belligerent Hutts might even brandish such weapons themselves. 

[P]The Arg'garok requires two hands to wield.

      [H3]Beastmaster's Vibro-Glaive[h3]

Most often found in the hands of the Weequay, these vibro-glaives consist of a heavy, single-edged head affixed to a pole up to two meters in length. Such weapons are particularly popular among the dark wolf beastmasters of Sriluur, who use the flat edge of the polearm to keep their charges in line, exploiting the glaive's reach to maintain a relatively safe distance from the lethal tails of the raquor'daan. The Weequay made use of vibro-glaives in their wars with the Houk, using these vicious weapons to even the odds in close combat. 

[P]The beastmaster's vibro-glaive requires two hands to wield.

Relics of the Morgukai, an ancient Nikto warrior society that hunted Jedi and Sith alike, these weapons are exceedingly rare. Crafted using lightsaber-resistant cortosis ore, the staves emit energy blades very similar to those of lightsabers. The Morgukai were declared an outlawed religious cult by the Galactic Empire and have long been thought extinct like the Jedi they once fought. 

[P]The cortosis staff requires two hands to wield.

Used by slavers across the galaxy to keep their "merchandise" in line, the neuronic whip is a terrible weapon banned on many worlds. A powerful electrical charge runs the length of this cruel wire whip, discharging when it strikes its target and sending painful impulses racing through its victim's nerve cells. The whip emits an ominous low humming sound when charged, exploding like the crack of a gunshot when it comes into contact its unfortunate target. 

[P]This weapon can be used to make melee attacks against targets at up to short range (the difficulty remains [B]Average [DI][DI][b]).

Long spears used by the Nikto, tuskbeast pikes were originally developed to hunt the giant, mutated predators of Kintan. Though tuskbeasts are now extinct, many Nikto still carry these weapons. Traditionally, the polearms' hafts are carved from slain tuskbeasts' ivory and bone, often elaborately carved with sacred images and poetry from Nikto mythology. 

[P]The tuskbeast pike requires two hands to wield.

Small, easily-concealed energy weapons, stingbeams are among the smallest blasters available. Tiny enough to fit in the palm of the hand, stingbeams work along similar principles to a blaster, but instead of firing a beam of energized particles down a barrel, they focus the blast along a needle-like rod that protrudes between the user's fingers. Stingbeams can kill at close range, but their blasts quickly lose cohesion over distance. 

[P]Add [SE][SE] to a character's Perception checks to find a stingbeam on a person's body.

Developed for use by Imperial agents, the 411 holdout blaster's supercharged actuator module and tight muzzle emitter give it impressive range for a holdout blaster. The increased range comes at the cost of overall stopping power when compared to other holdout blasters. Though intended for the exclusive use of the Empire, Rebels stole the design specifications and a large shipment of 411s, flooding the black market with the small, deadly weapons.

      [H3]Liquidsilver L7 Light Blaster Pistol[h3]

A simple, inexpensive blaster pistol, the Liquidsilver L7 has developed a reputation among smugglers as a good weapon to have in a pinch. The L7's compact size, clean lines, and steel finish make the blaster fairly inconspicuous and easy to overlook, especially if stowed for quick and easy access on the wall of a cargo hold or beside the gangplank servos of a light freighter. 

[P]Add [SE][SE] to a character's Perception checks to notice a Liquidsilver L7 light blaster pistol stashed aboard a starship.

Reliable, easy to maintain, and simple to modify, the Merr-Sonn Model 53 "Quicktrigger" blaster pistol has become popular among people living on the fringe. Though not the most powerful blaster available, the Quicktrigger can be readily customized with upgrades and attachments to suit the needs of individual users. Due to its simple design and rugged frame, the Model 53 is relatively easy to maintain and repair, and it rarely suffers more than minor damage from repeated firing. 

[P]Reduce the difficulty of Mechanics checks to repair a Model 53 or modify attachments on it by one.

      [H3]Raider Arms Model-1 "Nova Viper" Blaster Pistol[h3]

When weapon designer Joran Raider, the man behind many of the galaxy's most successful blasters, left BlasTech to start his own small manufacturing firm, it was a blow to the arms giant. Rumors persist that several notorious bounty hunters contracted by BlasTech to eliminate its former employee were bought off by Raider with examples of what many believe to be the pinnacle of his craft, the Model-1 Nova Viper blaster pistol. Perfectly balanced, innovative, and tooled down to a fraction of a micrometer, Raider Arms customizes every Nova Viper sold for its buyer, from its grip to its finish. As such, Nova Viper blasters are highly sought after and cost nearly as much as a new speeder. The blaster's incredible precision comes with a hidden price as well, requiring careful maintenance and exceptional skill to repair. Nonetheless, a fringer who manages to obtain a Nova Viper would almost invariably count himself lucky and consider it among his most valued possessions. 

[P]Increase the difficulty of Mechanics checks to repair a Nova Viper or modify attachments on it by one.

Based on a custom made design by the infamous bounty hunter Dragoneye, Czerka Arms C-10 heavy blaster pistol has become a popular sidearm for bounty hunters, smugglers, and other (ringers who value firepower over subtlety. Larger than most other heavy blasters, the Dragoneye Reaper is nearly as lethal as some blaster rifles, and users can easily modify it to suit their needs. While Czerka owns the rights to the Dragoneye Reaper, Caliban's Model X and SoroSuub "Renegade' heavy blaster pistols share many design elements and bear a striking resemblance to the C-10.

Larger and heavier than most other sporting blaster rifles, the Herloss HBt-4 hunting blaster packs a very heavy punch for a civilian blaster. Designed for hunting big game and the large, aggressive predators of the Outer Rim, the HBt-4 forgoes the long range of many sporting rifles in favor of a more concentrated blast that disperses relatively quickly. The HBt-4 is most commonly found on rough terrain or tropical worlds with heavy vegetation, where its shorter range is not a handicap. The hunting blaster has also found a place aboard some light freighters where its ready firepower provides an extra sense of security.

Often used by urban riot police and bounty hunters, the Corondexx VES-700 pulse rifle has also found a place aboard many of the light freighters roaming the galaxy. Firing a rapid series of micro-bursts in a wide blast pattern, the pulse rifle is particularly effective in closed spaces, such as the corridors of a starship.

Produced by Felebreck Electrical Defense Systems, the Droid Disabler is a small but powerful ionization pistol intended to damage, rather than merely incapacitate, droids. Though ineffective at anything but very short ranges, the massive ion blast emitted by a Droid Disabler can permanently fuse the circuits of virtually any unshielded droid, leaving it nothing more than a heap of lifeless scrap. Though devastating to droids and cybernetics, the ion blast doesn't harm living tissue. Due to the compact size of the energy cell and the large power requirements of the weapon, the Droid Disabler can only be fired a few times before the energy pack needs to be replaced.

Manufactured by Malaxan Firepower Incorporated, the FWG-5 is a smaller, pistol-sized improvement on flechette launchers made by larger firms such as Golan Arms and the Salus Corporation. Firing a small canister or pellet filled with scores of tiny needle-like darts known as flechettes, the FWG-5 is a lethal and terrifying weapon. Effective even against armored targets, the pellets explode with tremendous energy upon hitting from their target, propelling the flechettes to tremendous speeds. Additionally, a laser-tracking system built into the weapon guides the pellets to their targets, allowing them to make minor adjustments in flight before showering their victims with a hail of deadly flechettes. Though outlawed in many systems, more than a few Smugglers keep an FWG-5 handy at all times.

A powerful, large-bore slugthrower produced by Adostic Arms, their 8-gauge scatter gun fires a hail of small steel pellets. Though based on primitive slugthrower technology, the weapon's bestial stopping power rivals that of a heavy blaster pistol. Made of modern, lightweight materials, the scatter gun incorporates a sophisticated recoil system to reduce the weapon's big kick when fired. Many smugglers and free traders prefer these weapons to blasters for their ability to spray the narrow corridors and airlocks of starships without fear of accidentally penetrating the hull of the vessel.

It is not always necessary or even desirable to kill a threat in order to neutralize it. While stun weapons are the most common nonlethal method of disabling a foe, they are by no means the only way to subdue an opponent. Knockout grenades are one method of incapacitating multiple targets without causing permanent damage. Filled with a tranquilizer gas, these grenades can quickly subdue most living things caught in their blast radius, sending them into a deep sleep. Poachers sometimes use grenades such as these to capture wild, dangerous predators, and knockout grenades can even take down large creatures if used in sufficient quantity. 
[P]Knockout grenades have no effect on targets wearing breath masks or without respiratory systems.

      [H3]SSB-1 Static Pistol[h3]

Originally developed by long defunct Systech Corporation several thousand years ago, the design was recently revived by SoroSuub as the SSB-1 static blaster pistol. Firing a powerful bolt of electricity generated by high-energy piezoelectric crystals within the weapon, the static blaster is only useful at close ranges, but a couple of blasts can bring down a Wookiee or even a full-grown gundark. Due to the exceptionally low energy requirements to supercharge the crystals, energy packs in static pistols can power the weapon through thousands of firings. However, the internal alignment of the crystals is very exact, and the pistol can stop functioning if damaged or roughly handled.

These devices were originally designed to extinguish fires aboard starships using a supercooling chemical agent, but independent operators quickly discovered that removing the safety nozzles from CryoBan projectors could turn them into lethal weapons. Many smugglers keep several of these stashed in strategic locations around their ships, both to put out fires and, if necessary, repel boarders. 

[P]CryoBan projectors can be used to fight fires. A character armed with a CryoBan projector adds [BO] to attempts to put out a fire. Assisted checks to extinguish the flames add one additional [BO] for each assist-ing character equipped with a CryoBan projector.

SHOCK BOOTS 
Though shock gloves are fairly common among criminals and law enforcement personnel alike, shock boots are a specialty item crafted for those who are determined not to be caught defenseless under any circumstances. A solid kick from these boots activates the miniature power generators and electrical circuitry in their soles, delivering a paralyzing shock to an opponent. Generally indistinguishable from normal boots, few notice shock boots' dangerous capabilities until it's too late. 

[P]Shock boots are worn on the feet, and thus do not require a hand to wield. Add [SE] to a character's Perception checks to notice that shock boots are a weapon rather than merely normal footwear.

      [H3]Punch Dagger[h3]

A punch dagger, also known as a push dagger or gimlet knife, is a small, short-bladed knife attached to a T-shaped handle, or "gimlet." The user grasps the gimlet so the blade protrudes between his fingers. Easily-concealed, the punch dagger allows the user the put considerable force behind a thrust, often piercing thick clothing and simple armor. A favorite holdout weapon among gamblers, a punch dagger typically won't set off the weapons detectors used in many gambling dens and the backrooms of cantinas throughout the galaxy. 

[P]Add [SE][SE] to a character's Perception checks made to find a punch dagger on a person's body.

A long, slender-bladed vibrosword, a vibrorapier is extremely well-balanced and suited for professional artists of the blade. Designed primarily for thrusting, the vibrorapier can penetrate virtually any armor, making it an exceptionally deadly blade in the hands of trained sword-wielder. Unlike other vibroblades, which emit an audible hum, vibrorapiers are completely silent, making them useful for those who rely on stealth to survive.

Designed to be used in conjunction with a vibrosword or other melee weapon, the blade-breaker is typically a small, serrated vibroblade or pronged dagger capable of catching and possibly even breaking an opponent's melee weapon. Equipped with an ultrasonic generator in the handle to increase the weapon's ability to shatter durasteel, a blade-breaker can quickly leave an opponent unarmed and at the mercy of its wielder.

      [H3]Mini Thermal Detonator[h3]

These insidious devices are half the size of frag grenades but have a thermite-baradium casing surrounding a baradium core. On detonation, the resulting fusion reaction creates a particle wave that disintegrates everything in the blast. One mini-detonator can clear a large room. The stats for them are as follows: (Ranged [Light]; Damage 12; Critical 2; Range [Short]; Blast 10). Blast 10 means that the attacker can spend 2 Advantage [AD][AD] to ensure the blast hits everyone within short range of the original target, dealing 10 damage to each. 

[P]Thermal detonators can be either set to detonate on impact, or be set with a timer to detonate up to 3 rounds after being activated at the beginning of the attacker's action. 

[P]This particular batch was defective, so the weapon only detonates if 3 Advantage [AD][AD][AD] or a Triumph [TR] are spent during the [B]Ranged (Light) check[b]. On a Despair [DE] it explodes prematurely in the wielder's hand.

      [H3]DR-45 "Dragoon" Calvalry Blaster[h3]

The DR-45 cavalry blaster by Merr-Sonn is one of a line of convertible blaster carbines marketed to vehicle crews and beast riders. Based on Merr-Sonris popular DD6 blaster pistol, the DR-45, also called the Dragoon, is marketed as an all-in-one weapon providing the portability of a blaster pistol with the range and stopping power of a blaster carbine. To accomplish this, the base weapon, which is a long-barreled blaster pistol, can be fitted with a detachable polycarbonate shoulder stock and a range-extending augmented spin barrel to turn it into a respectably effective blaster carbine. The stock and barrel are fixed to the base weapon with sturdy quick-release mounts that allow an experienced user to mount or dismount the attachments quickly and easily. While not particularly common, Dragoon cavalry blasters are slowly finding a following among members of the Rebel Alliance who value their versatility, reliability, and stopping power. 

[P]Converting the DR-45 from a pistol to a carbine takes one maneuver and changes the weapon's combat skill from Ranged (Light) to Ranged (Heavy). Similarly, it takes one maneuver to convert the weapon back, restoring its combat skill to Ranged (Light).

    <Description>
      [H3]E5 Blaster Carbine[h3]

The E5 by Baktoid Armor Workshop is a carbine version of their venerable E-5 blaster rifle. Lighter and shorter than its full-sized cousin, the E5 was released in the beginning months of the Clone Wars and saw wide use among vehicle crews and special operatives of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This weapon was also issued to B1 battle droids, and is the weapon with which those droids are most associated. Like its larger cousin the E-5 blaster rifle, the E5 carbine was based on an earlier BlasTech design which was reverse-engineered by weaponsmiths at Baktoid Armor Workshop for use with their 00M, B1, and BX series droids. It's a relatively reliable blaster that provides respectable stopping power in a small, easy-to-handle package. In addition to its lightened frame and shortened barrel, the E5 also features a foldable stock that further increases its usability. As they were largely designed for use by droids, vehicle crews, and rear-echelon troops, E5 carbines suffer from a few noticeable drawbacks. They are relatively inaccurate over long distances, and thanks to cost-cutting during development, many of their systems are built of substandard materials, making them comparatively fragile and prone to overheating during heavy use. While not particularly liked or well-respected weapons, E5 carbines are cheap and readily available, having been built by the hundreds of thousands during the Clone Wars. This makes them very attractive to more cash-strapped members of the Rebel Alliance. 

[P]During combat, the Game Master can spend [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] to force an E5 to overheat, damaging it by one step as if stuck by a weapon with the Sunder quality (see page 170 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook).

    <Description>
      [H3]HH-50 Heavy Blaster Pistol[h3]

BlasTech's HH-50 is a heavy, double-barreled, large-frame blaster pistol designed mainly for hunting large and dangerous animals. Nearly the size of a blaster carbine, and sharing a number of parts and systems with the Clone Wars-era DC-15 blaster carbine, the HH-50 is the largest, heaviest, highest-output blaster pistol currently produced by BlasTech. Popular with beast riders, vehicle crews, and cavalry scouts, the HH-50 packs a blaster rifle's worth of stopping power into a relatively small and easy to use package. Using a patented dual-circuit galven pattern, an overcharged XCiter, and a powerful mix of blaster gases, the HH-50 fires both barrels with one pull of the trigger, allowing it to pierce the thickest hide. The downside to all of this stopping power is that the HH-50 is incredibly inefficient, even for a heavy blaster pistol, and tends to run its blaster gas chamber dry at the most inopportune times.

[P]During combat, Game Masters may make an HH-50 run out of ammunition by spending [TH][TH]. This is in addition to the standard spending of [DE]. In addition, the Game Master can spend [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] to force an HH-50 to overheat, damaging it by one step as if stuck by a weapon with the Sunder quality (see page 170 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook).

      [H3]Longeing Whip[h3]

Used for guiding riderless beasts and driving teams of creatures, a longeing whip is an essential piece of a beast rider's kit. Made by companies such as Piccatech Ltd. and Xenovet, longeing whips typically consist of a hide or synthetic textile-wrapped composite haft between one and two meters in length. A thin, flexible lash extends from the haft another two meters and is used mainly to make noise to recall a wandering or distracted beast to its duty. Although mainly a tool, a longeing whip also makes a decent improvised weapon, especially in the hands of an experienced user. Its length and flexibility allows a user to keep a threat at a comfortable distance, and the lash can be used to distract and even entangle an assailant.

      [H3]SoroSuub "Persuader" Shock Prod[h3]

SoroSuub's Persuader, officially known as the Model VIII Animal Shock Prod, uses the technology found in force pikes and shock batons to control large, thick-skinned beasts. A little over two meters long, the Persuader is a long, narrow rod with a thicker haft at one end and a multi-pronged tip at the other. The haft contains the prod's power cell and controls as well as the non-slip handgrips. When activated the Persuader emits a variable electrical charge with an intensity that can be adjusted from a light sting that gets a creature's attention to a powerful discharge that can knock a fully grown Wookiee unconscious or render a rampaging rancor meek and biddable. 

[P]Persuader Animal Shock Prods require two hands to wield. This weapon has the Slow-Firing 1 rule, representing its electrical charge having to recharge. On rounds during which it is recharging, if the character wants to attack with it, he can only use it as an improvised weapon (see page 225 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook).

      [H3]Alternating-Fire Concussion Missile Launcher[h3]

The more common and less powerful of the two types of shipboard ordnance, concussion missiles are found on all manner of spacecraft, from tiny starfighters to capital ships. Roughly a meter long, a concussion missile employs special warheads, combining a hardened durasteel penetrator that uses kinetic force to pierce through a ship's armor and a shaped high-explosive charge that causes damage through both explosive force and concussive shock. Concussion missiles are primarily anti-fighter weapons, used to quickly deal crippling damage to starfighters and patrol boats, although they perform well against larger targets as well.

The concept behind flak cannons dates back to the earliest days of powered flight, and is among the simplest, most effective anti-fightercraft weapon systems in use today. Using a powerful mass driver, a flak cannon fires a large-caliber shell packed with thousands of dangerous, tiny objects such as shrapnel, micro-explosive pellets, or inert durasteel flechettes. Flak shells burst at a set distance and spread their contents in a dense cloud that can tear small, lightly armored airspeeders or starfighters to shreds in an instant.

      [H3]Anti-Personnel Mine[h3]

Simple, deadly weapons deployed by countless military and paramilitary forces throughout the galaxy, anti-personnel mines are, outside of hand grenades, the most common portable ordnance in use. Cheap, easy to use, and frightfully efficient weapons, anti-personnel mines come in a number of forms, from simple explosive devices buried in the ground that detonate when stepped on to sophisticated weapons that fire blaster bolts, gouts of fire, clouds of shrapnel, or other deadly ordnance designed to shred squads of approaching infantry. Much smaller and lighter than anti-vehicle mines, one or two anti-personnel mines can easily be carried by a single trooper. They are usually deployed with their larger cousins around fortifications and on the battlefield to protect assets or disrupt enemy troop movement, or as part of booby traps or sabotage. The major drawback to anti-personnel mines is, much like flame projectors and thermal detonators, they can inadvertently target allies. In addition, the production and use of these weapons is banned on many worlds due to the fact that unexploded mines can remain active and ready to kill on battlefields well after the fighting is over.

      [H3]Anti-Vehicle Mine[h3]

Anti-vehicle mines are large, heavy explosive devices designed to destroy walkers, speeders, and other landborne vehicles. When deployed, they are buried in shallow pits and covered with soil, leaves, duracrete, or other camouflaging agents. They feature both an adjustable pressure switch that can be set to detonate at a certain weight threshold and a proximity sensor that detects the presence of repulsor fields. When triggered, either by weight or by a landspeeder passing over them, their precision-shaped anti-armor charge detonates, damaging the typically soft underbellies of armored vehicles. Anti-vehicle mines are usually deployed in groups, depending on their intended use, and are used to protect fortifications and encampments as well as to deny vehicle access to battlefields and sensitive areas. While quite deadly, anti-vehicle mines present little danger to personnel, as even at their most sensitive setting, they require the weight of a vehicle or the presence of a repulsor field to activate.

      [H3]Armor-Piercing Grenade[h3]

Armor-piercing grenades, commonly known as AP grenades, are offensive grenades designed to give an individual trooper respectable anti-armor capabilities. Used as both anti-armor and anti-materiel weapons, most AP grenades use precisely calibrated shaped charges housed in specially designed casings to focus all of their explosive force on one small area. This allows them to be deployed against armored vehicles or structures with little collateral damage to the surrounding area. Despite their tightly focused area of effect, AP grenades still have a decent blast area. One or two tossed into a squad of Imperial stormtroopers or other soldiers in heavy armor can cause more damage than a whole handful of frag grenades. 

[P]Many AP grenades, especially those designed specifically for anti-armor and anti-materiel work, are equipped with either a magnetic or chemical adhesive system that allows them to be placed on walls, floors, and vehicle hulls for pinpoint demolitions and targeted sabotage. 

[P]Like frag grenades, AP grenades can be set to detonate on impact, set with a timer to detonate up to 3 rounds after being activated, or use a pressure detonator.

      [H3]Battleship Ion Cannon[h3]

Ion weapons are anti-ship and anti-vehicle weapons designed to disable rather than destroy their targets. They use ion turbine generators to create masses of negatively charged particles which are fused with plasma and released as blasts or pulses. The negatively charged particles interfere with a target's electrical systems, shorting circuits, corrupting computers, and forcing system shutdowns in an effort to subdue a target or make it easier to destroy via more traditional means. Although designed to do little-to-no physical damage to targets, collateral damage such as fried circuits, fused joints, and even fires may occur due to the intense energy surges.

      [H3]Fusion Cutter[h3]

These handheld, portable cutting torches are found throughout the galaxy in numerous industrial, technical, and even artistic operations. They use small, high-powered fusion batteries to produce intense plasma or laser beams used to weld metals together and to cut them apart, depending on the needs of the user. Their beams can easily cut through durasteel, duraplast, and even armored ship hulls with ease. Field mechanics often carry them into battle for emergency repairs of vehicles, droids, and other equipment. Fusion cutters can be adjusted to produce a fine, precise beam for welds or a broad, powerful beam good for brazing and cutting. Engineering and mechanic droids can have a fusion cutter directly installed in their chassis so that they always have one at hand, and they are especially common on astromech druids. In a pinch, a fusion cutter can be used as a close-quarters weapon, and can cause some incredibly frightful wounds. If used as a weapon, a fusion cutter has a range of engaged, deals 5 damage, has a critical rating of 3, and possesses the Breach 1, Burn 3, Sunder, and Vicious 3 weapon qualities.

A laser cannon is the standard weapon for use by most starships and other vehicles. It exists in a myriad of forms, from the huge versions used by starships, through medium-sized turret-mounted variants, to the much smaller personal cannons sometimes carried by infantry. Although they are capable of causing a considerable amount of damage, they are no match to some of the more advanced beam weapons such as electromagnetic plasma cannons, turbolasers and superlasers.

When confronted with a hostile situation, a quick escape is sometimes the wisest course of action. Other times, fatally wounding individuals might cause a diplomatic disaster or have other repercussions. In such situations, nonlethal grenades are the best recourse, providing a relatively cheap area-of-effect alternative to a stun shot. When deployed, Merr-Sonn N-4 noise grenades and other similar weapons release a horrendous burst of sound across the spectrum, causing temporary but incredibly intense pain in most sentient species. The cacophony typically lasts for only a few seconds, but the lingering effects give the user a chance to escape or seize the initiative.

      [H3]SoroSuub Wipe-3 Data-Purge Grenade[h3]

Although information is sometimes committed to flimsiplast or other forms of physical storage, most data storage utilizes electronic media. Overwhelming physical damage can eliminate memory banks and similar devices, but expert slicing can sometimes reconstitute and extract viable data. For more certain methods of data erasure, agents turn to devices like SoroSuub Wipe-3 data-purge grenades. These small, one-use devices release a focused pulse that scrambles data, usually without destroying hardware. 

[P]Any computer or similar device hit by a data-purge grenade loses all programming, memory, or any other kind of electronically stored data, but remains otherwise undamaged. A droid hit by a data-purge grenade must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Resilience check[b] or suffer 1 strain, plus 1 additional strain per [FA]. At the GM's discretion, [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] on the check can cause the droid to lose portions of its memory.

Another favorite tool for nonlethal personnel control, knockout charges such as Brennkeyes Syndicate safety mines allow the user to safely concentrate on other tasks while being assured early warning in the case of unwanted guests—at least, those who need to breath. Smaller and more easily concealed than their lethal counterparts, the mines are typically placed at head height and triggered via laser tripwire. Upon detonation, a knockout mine releases a flash of light and a neuroparalytic that halts organics who inhale it. 

[P]A character hit by a knockout mine must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI])  Resilience check[b]. If he fails, he becomes immobilized until the end of the encounter.

When discovered in a compromising position, an operative might prefer a nonlethal means to disable foes, particularly if those foes are left with little beyond a clouded recollection of events. Goseia Heavy Industries Concern "Mercy" grenades—more often called nightmare grenades in the criminal underworld—fill this need, emitting a hallucinogenic gas that distorts perceptions, provokes intense visual illusions, impairs memory, and creates intense feelings of paranoia and dread. Nightmare grenades are generally held to be less reliable than their explosive counterparts because the effect of the gas varies wildly, and because species that do not need to breath are unaffected by them. 

[P]A character hit by a "Mercy" grenade must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Resilience check[b]. If he fails the check, he later has an incomplete or inaccurate memory of events that transpire during that encounter. Additionally, he becomes disoriented for 1 round per [TH] on the check.

To all appearances, needle gloves look like typical hand coverings. Indeed, they differ so little from actual gloves that they offer very little in combat, with a sole exception: by making a specific hand gesture, the wearer can extend an ultra-thin needle that is otherwise practically undetectable. 

[P]Needle Gloves may be loaded with 1 dose of neurotoxin, anesthetic, neuroparalytic (see page 188 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook), or any other poison the GM deems appropriate. Whenever the wielder successfully attacks a target with the weapon (even if he deals no damage), the target also suffers the effects of being exposed to the poison. Add [SE][SE][SE] to a character's Perception checks to determine that a set of needle gloves contain a lethal weapon.

Popular among all manner of individuals from nobles to vagabonds, vibroblades are effective cutting edges that, when powered, can easily slice through light armor. Compared to traditional melee weapons, a vibroweapon can be smaller, but still extremely deadly. Many corporations have sought to fill this niche by producing vibroknives with a bare minimum of technology—essentially a naked blade with a thin handle and miniaturized motivator. Such blades can be correspondingly more dangerous to wield, but they offer the advantage of being easily hidden and difficult to detect. 

Add [SE][SE] to a character's Perception checks to find a stealth vibroknife on a person's body. 

[P][B]Models include:[b] Palandrix Compact Utility Blade.

Producing a number of high-quality blaster weapons, the Drearian Defense Conglomerate is especially known for supplying the Corporate Sector Authority. However, several of their models have achieved popularity among the aristocracy and nobility. The DDC Defender pistol is typically used in honor duels and hunting, but it offers a number of distinct advantages for other uses. Its small size and simple disassembly method make it easily concealable, and the weapon also boasts automatic minor-malfunction repair and an unusually large number of shots per charge. While not the strongest of weapons, those who master it for hunting and dueling find their skills transfer well to more deadly contexts.

The presentation of weapons in various rituals has a strong root in many cultures, especially those with a militaristic past. Such practices usually stem from ancient history, so exchanges usually incorporate seemingly anachronistic armaments such as swords, axes, spears, or other such items. Such an award often signifies a high honor to the recipient, and many choose to include them in their formal dress for all future occasions. Naturally, given how highly prized such items are, they also often feature correspondingly high craftsmanship, with superior killing power in addition to beautiful design. 

[P]A character adds [BO] when attempting to convince others to allow him to retain his ceremonial blade.

      [H3]Military Holdout Blaster[h3]

Diplomats rarely fare as well as their allies in extended firefights or brawls, but sometimes, a single shot might be sufficient to enable escape from a perilous situation. Many governments, therefore, outfit representatives with more powerful versions of the oft-employed holdout blasters. Like the civilian variants, such weapons can be easily hidden and drawn quickly, allowing the user to get off an unexpected shot at a critical moment. Military models, by contrast, typically fire a more powerful blast, at the cost of limited ammunition capacity. 

[P]Add [SE] to a character's Perception checks to find a military holdout blaster on a person's body. During combat, GMs may make a military holdout blaster run out of ammunition by spending [TH][TH][TH]. This is in addition to the standard spending of [DE], as discussed on page 218 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook. 

[P][B]Models include:[b] Czerka Arms 411, BlasTech C-91.

The ELG-3A differs slightly from the Merr-Sonn 02 model of blaster pistol, but shares the traits of being lightweight and distinctively elegant in design. Considered by many to be a "diplomat's blaster," the ELG-3A was particularly popular among Naboo's Royal Security Force. Like a holdout blaster, the weapon is easily concealable, but its longer barrel gives it better precision than many holdout pistols—a necessary trait given that the weapon's relatively light power necessitates especially accurate marksmanship to ensure fatal wounds.

[P]Add [SE][SE] to a characters Perception checks to find an ELG-3A on a person's body.

A traditional accessory of aristocracy who occasionally need to instill an important lesson, the sword cane combines the merits of a walking stick with accessible protection. Designs can vary wildly, with some users preferring fancy and shiny rods, while other wielders opt for more subdued staves. Typically, a simple twist releases the handle from the sheath, allowing the wielder to draw the blade in a rapid, smooth motion. Some incorporate a vibroblade as the hidden sword, but the majority of models feature an unpowered blade for better concealment. While sword cane lack the weight and killing power of a dedicated combat blade, it is a valuable defensive weapon and can still be deadly in master duellist's hands. 

[P]Add [SE] to a character's Perception checks to determine that a sword cane is actually a lethal weapon. 

[P][B]Models include:[b] SoroSuub Elegance-4 Cane, Drolan Platted Sword Cane.

      [H3]Staff of Office[h3]

Although worlds vary by custom, a great majority use historical or symbolic regalia and accessories to distinguish their diplomats, envoys, and other such luminaries from simple common folk. These items take a wide variety of forms, but many cultures often grant such figures a rod of office, walking staff, or a similarly grandiose stick. Because it is a symbol of office, such implements rarely set off weapon detectors, and their holders are rarely required them to surrender them as they would blasters, vibroknives, and the like. Some foresighted individuals use this to their advantage and train using their staff of office as a blunt-force weapon for worst-case scenarios. 

[P]A staff of office requires two hands to wield. A character adds [BO][BO] when attempting to convincing others to allow him to retain his staff of office.

      [H3]Shoto[h3]

Essentially miniaturized lightsabers, shotos are one of the more common lightsaber variants. A lightsaber created for duelists. the shoto was initially designed as an offhand weapon for individuals who practiced the two-handed Jar'Kai school of lightsaber combat. As they grew in popularity, shotos were adopted as a primary weapon by Jedi and Sith whose small statures made the use of a standard-sized lightsaber difficult or impossible. Some, especially students of the Ataru school, forsook standard-sized lightsabers altogether, instead wielding two shotos. This allowed these individuals to make good use of the acrobatic forms inherent in Ataru to deliver quicker and more accurate blows than an individual wielding a single full-sized lightsaber or even a lightsaber/shoto combination. Perhaps the most famous shoto user was the Jedi Master Yoda, who carried a green-bladed shoto which he used to shocking effect. 

[P]This lightsaber is a basic shoto hilt containing an unmodded Ilum lightsaber crystal (see page 197). This crystal occupies two of the weapon's hard points. 

[P]When installing a lightsaber crystal into a shoto, reduce the damage of that lightsaber crystal by 1.

      [H3]Lightsaber Pike[h3]

Largely considered a ceremonial weapon, long associated with temple guards and Imperial bodyguards. lightsaber pikes are nevertheless potent and dangerous weapons in the right hands. Similar in construction to a force pike or electrostaff, a lightsaber pike consists of a long, sturdy haft typically made of composites or strong alloys. The haft, while a respectable weapon in its own right, contains the internal workings of a standard lightsaber. When activated, a shoto-length blade springs from the end of the haft, creating a weapon between two and three meters long. Its size gives the lightsaber pike incredible reach and respectable defensive capabilities. 

[P]This lightsaber is a basic lightsaber pike hilt containing an unmodded Ilum lightsaber crystal (see page 197). This crystal occupies two of the weapon's hard points.

      [H3]Basic Lightsaber[h3]

The basic lightsaber is, in essence, the baseline to which all other lightsabers and their variants are compared. It consists of a basic hilt constructed from whatever material was available to the builder, typically metal or composites. Simple weapons, though still exceedingly elegant, all lightsabers are equipped with some form of kyber crystal. Kyber crystals are actually a broad family of different types of crystals. Though these can vary in shape and coloration, and even certain properties, kyber crystals share certain unique attributes. These attributes allow kyber crystals to be used within lightsabers, enabling them to focus the lightsabers' power into their signature energy blades. Prior to the rise of the Empire, nearly every lightsaber constructed by the Jedi Order during the Clone Wars contained a crystal gathered by a Padawan on the planet Ilum as part of the journey to become a Jedi Knight. These Ilum specimens are some of the best examples of kyber crystals. 

[P]This lightsaber is a basic lightsaber hilt containing an unmodded Ilum lightsaber crystal (see page 197). This crystal occupies two of the weapon's hard points.

      [H3]Double-Bladed Lightsaber[h3]

Known colloquially among Force adherents as lightstaffs or Sith lightsabers, the dangerous double-bladed I ightsabers were first designed by the Dark Lords of the Old Sith Empire. Double-bladed lightsabers consist of an oversized lightsaber hilt equipped with an upgraded power supply and twin emitter systems and crystals, one at either end of the hilt. When activated, a full-sized lightsaber blade springs from each emitter, making an exceptionally potent weapon nearly as long as a full-grown human. The weapon's twin blades allow a user to strike more rapidly, and sometimes fight multiple foes at once. Although quite dangerous and effective in combat, double-bladed lightsabers are also exceptionally difficult to master. Nevertheless, some Jedi constructed double-bladed lightsabers for themselves, including some notable figures in ancient Jedi myth. 
[P]Although technically, this weapon contains two lightsaber crystals (one for each blade), for the purposes of gameplay it is treated as having a single crystal. This lightsaber is a double-bladed lightsaber hilt containing an unmodded Hum lightsaber crystal (see page 197). This crystal occupies two of the weapon's hard points. 
[P]When purchasing attachments for this weapon (including crystals), each attachment costs double the listed price. This represents the fact that the double-bladed lightsaber generally requires two of each attachment (one for each end). However, when installing and modding these attachments, follow all normal rules.

      [H3]Training Lightsaber[h3]

Designed to train Force users in lightsaber use, training lightsabers are low-powered, non-lethal variants of standard lightsabers. Equipped with an ultra-low-output power generator and either a kathracite or danite crystal, a training lightsaber produces a blade that, while possessing the same mass and energy characteristics as its full-powered cousins, does no lasting damage to living beings. Its permanent low-power setting allows younglings and initiates to practice their lightsaber techniques without the risk of maiming or killing their sparring partners. This is not to say that using 
a training lightsaber is without its risks: strikes from a training lightsaber cause heavy bruising, painful welts, and even mild bums. As they are simply common lightsabers with internal modifications, training lightsabers can be turned into full-powered lightsabers simply by changing out the power generator and replacing the crystal with a more formidable one. 

[P]This lightsaber is a basic lightsaber hilt containing an unmodded training lightsaber emitter (see page 200). This crystal occupies two of the weapon's hard points.

The making and use of cortosis swords is, perhaps, as old as the making and use of lightsabers. Cortosis swords were created to counter the elegant and deadly lightsabers wielded by Jedi and other Force adherents, and hopefully to grant their non—Force-using wielders some hope of survival against a determined lightsaber user. Built in a variety of styles, and using varying amounts of cortosis ore in their construction, cortosis-bladed swords, in the right hands, pose a decided threat to even the most powerful Force user.

Some whisper that those early Force-sensitive warriors could somehow imbue these weapons with the Force, making them stronger, keener, and more deadly. Whatever the truth of these rumors, there are still examples of such swords in the galaxy today. Some are artfully crafted replicas or commissioned by specific warriors, while a Few are treasured heirlooms preserved from the mists of the distant past.

      [H3]Cortosis Shield[h3]

While law enforcement officers and some mercenaries might carry high-tech riot shields for use in crowd control situations, the common defensive shield is vanishingly rare on the battlefield. In the modern era of focused energy weapons, high-powered slugthrowers, and ship- and vehicle-mounted ordnance that can turn a sentient into a pile of ash in a heartbeat, even plastoid armor is of arguable value. In the face of heavy fire, most individuals prefer either to present an overwhelming force or to retreat. Those who deal with the remnants of the Jedi Order, such as the Inquisitors and the secret police units of the Galactic Empire, often have need of specialized equipment.

[P]Cortosis shields are made from various alloys or synthetic compounds and are laced with a refined cortosis weave that absorbs blaster energy and can even turn or disrupt the blade of a lightsaber. Due to their inherent strength, cortosis shields can be used as a makeshift Melee weapon, allowing a user to bash or push away an opponent.

From the basic, utilitarian staff of a nerf herder to high-tech weapons used to subdue unruly mobs, staffs are ubiquitous throughout the galaxy. However, what would normally be a simple and common tool can be modified into a uniquely effective weapon against Force users through the use of refined cortosis. In most forms. cortosis ore resists and absorbs energy, allowing items to withstand blows from weapons that would normally shatter them. However, specifically refined cortosis has a unique secondary effect: it can short out lightsaber blades on contact, Working with this refined cortosis is extremely difficult due to the properties of the ore, and even making a simple weapon like a staff is inordinately expensive. However, such weapons can prove a deadly advantage if someone has to face down a lightsaber-wielding enemy.

[P]When a character armed with a lightsaber makes a combat check targeting an opponent armed with a refined cortosis staff, [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] can be spent to cause the lightsaber to short out and deactivate after the combat check has been resolved. When a character armed with a refined cortosis staff makes a combat check targeting a character armed with a lightsaber, the attacking character may spend [AD][AD][AD] or [TR] to cause the lightsaber to short out and deactivate after the combat check has been resolved. The lightsaber may be reactivated as an incidental, but it may not be reactivated until after the last Initiative slot during the next round. Cortosis staffs require two hands to use.

Electrostaffs first saw widespread use during the Clone Wars among Separatist forces, especially among the personal guard droids of General Grievous. Over two meters long. electrostaves are designed to keep a Jedi or other lightsaber wielder at arms' length. Constructed from lightweight, highly durable phrik alloy. a mixture of phrikite, tydirium, and other trace ores, electrostaves can resist a lightsaber blade. In addition to their defensive capabilities, electrostaves are also equipped with small electromagnetic pulse generators at each end that constantly crackle and spit showers of sparks when active. Like force pikes, electrostaves can be set to a number of different power outputs: a mild shock used to control crowds; a powerful Stun setting that can sideline even the toughest opponent: or the full-power setting that can easily tear a sentient in half.

      [H3]Lightsaber Pike Hilt[h3]

The soul of each lightsaber is its crystal. The Jedi of old tested their younglings by sending them to search for their lightsaber crystals. The process was as much a spiritual journey as a physical search, with the trainees confronting their inner demons as part of the process. In finding a crystal, they bonded with it in a way that transcended the physical realm. 

[P]The hilt of the lightsaber, on the other hand, is a primarily mechanical system. Individuals can customize a hilt, adding ornamentation or additional functionality just as they can with any weapon or item. In this way, an individual can make a unique hilt that is truly his, but it is still simply an item. 

[P]Provided here are the hilts for the lightsabers listed in this chapter. Each requires a crystal to become a true weapon (otherwise they deal no damage, have no critical rating, and do not have many of their item qualities). However, a PC wanting to construct their own lightsabers should start with a hilt. If the PC wants to construct his own hilt out of available materials, the GM can still have him make a check to find the hilt, based on its rarity, and pay the cost. This represents the PC finding and paying for the raw materials. Then it is simply a matter of spending a few hours putting the materials together to build the hilt—no checks are necessary.

      [H3]Variable Holdout Blaster[h3]
[P]The variable holdout blaster is a sleek, easily conceal- able design with a variable power setting. The pistol has been popular with spies, informants, and covert Rebels on the planet of Ord Gimmel for some time. The power level of the weapon’s blast is adjustable, allowing for more or less damage capacity as desired by the user. The tradeoff for the weapon’s combination of utility and concealability is that the pistol’s power cell is limited.
[P]When firing the weapon, the pistol’s wielder must choose a power setting between 1 and 7. This is the amount of damage a successful shot inflicts on a target, but it is also the amount of ammo that is consumed for the shot. If set to a power setting higher than the available ammo left, the weapon deals damage equal to the amount of ammo remaining.
[P]Anyone searching an individual carrying a concealed variable holdout blaster adds [SE] to their Perception checks.

[P]Produced by SoroSuub and popular with many Sullustan members of the Rebel Alliance, the CS-1 2 stun master is one of the most ubiquitous non-lethal weapons in the Alliance’s arsenal. Palm-sized and effective, it is easily concealed and is legal to carry in most systems. In addition, the device is constructed from consumer-grade materials and can be smuggled past standard weapon detection devices without raising alarms.
[P]Designed as a small cylinder only fifteen centimeters in length, the stun master has thirteen contact studs that emerge from its disk-shaped business end. When these contacts are pressed against an opponent and the device activated, a silent electric charge is released that results in unconsciousness or disorientation.
[P]Add [SE] to a character’s Perception checks to find a stun master on a person’s body

      [H3]Mon Calamari Coral Pike[h3]
    [P]The coral pike is an ancient weapon of the Mon Calamari people. Despite its status as a ceremonial weapon, the coral pike is an effective Melee weapon that combines elements of a force pike with Mon Calamari craftsmanship. Coral pike blades are crafted from a particularly dense breed of coral native only to Mon Cala. Once a craftsperson has defined the general shape of the blade, it is sharpened to a nearly monomolecular edge using precise lasers. The result is a unique weapon with an edge that never dulls.
[P]Every coral pike is made by hand, and no two are exactly alike. They are often carved with symbols
denoting Mon Calamari rank and familial ties. For individuals who are considered friends of the Mon Calamari people, the gift of a coral pike is a great honor and represents an eternal bond that transcends species.

   [P]Wielded by the Mon Calamari Knights during the Clone Wars, energy lances are designed to be used from atop a mount. Essentially force pikes equipped with electromagnetic pulse generators, they are primarily intended for use against droids and vehicles. Despite this specialization, they are perfectly capable of inflicting grievous damage on organic targets.
[P]Former members of the Mon Calamari Knights still carry their lances with them, especially when fighting mounted against droids and vehicles. Reflecting the strict requirements of knighthood among the Mon Cal, these lances are symbols of their duty and commitment to their people.
[P]If he is mounted, the wielder of an energy lance may use his steed’s Brawn rating to determine the damage of this weapon instead of his own Brawn rating. If the wielder is not mounted, the weapon has the Cumbersome 3 quality.

      [H3]Mini-Torpedo, Ink[h3]
[P]These mini-torpedoes contain a reservoir filled with an obscuring black liquid that readily disperses into a large cloud upon detonation. Not only does the ink obscure vision and block sight lines, but anyone directly affected by the cloud is liable to become disoriented. The ink cloud lasts for up to four rounds, but it can last much longer in particularly still water.

      [H3]Mon Cal Defenses Mini-Torpedo Launcher[h3]
[P]The Mon Cal Defenses mini-torpedo launcher is a portable weapon designed exclusively for sub-aquatic combat situations. Based on a design that was originally only integrated into suits of heavy armor, the portable version is small enough to be considered a squad support weapon.
[P]Featuring an integrated two-torpedo magazine, the mini-torpedo launcher is capable of using standard anti-personnel mini-torpedoes, as well as specialized torpedoes depending on combat requirements. Though unguided, the torpedoes are extremely accurate, especially in the hands of a skilled operator.
[P]The mini-torpedo launcher can only be used effectively underwater. All combat checks to operate it outside of the water have their difficulty upgraded twice. The profile provided with this weapon is for the default torpedoes. Specialized torpedoes can be loaded into the launcher. While these torpedoes are loaded, they replace the damage, critical rating, range, and item qualities of the original weapon with their own. Regardless of what is loaded in the launcher, it maintains the Cumbersome quality.

      [H3]Bola Carbine[h3]
     [P]Individually handcrafted by weaponsmiths, the bola carbine is a unique and somewhat rare blaster carbine. Natural wood is used in the weapon’s construction, specifically in the forearm, stock, and butt assemblies. Though use of wood increases the weapon’s weight when compared to modern materials, it allows for a large amount of personalization for individual users.
[P]The most unusual feature of the bola carbine is the charge it fires. The blaster bolt discharged by the weapon is combined with a series of hard energy particles that are capable of producing a small energy net that can ensnare targets. Though they ensnare targets for a fairly brief amount of time, the hard energy particles often make a difference, especially when the user is being pursued by enemies

      [H3]Droid Disruptor[h3]
    [P]Verpine weaponsmiths enjoy creating specialized weapons, such as the Verpine droid disruptor. Unlike a typical ionization blaster, the droid disruptor fires a targeted stream of coherent ion energy that overloads and burns out droid circuitry and processors. As a result, droids deactivated by a droid disruptor are largely irreparable.
[P]Due to the deadly nature of droid disruptors—at least, to droids—droids tend to view them in the same manner in which organics view disruptor weapons. The weapons are also effective against electronic equipment, though the damage caused to vehicles and vessels is largely negligible unless specifically targeted at a particular vehicular system at point-blank range.
[P]When used against organic creatures, the droid disruptor is much less effective. Any organic creature struck by a droid disruptor does not receive normal damage, but instead simply experiences a brief shock to the system and suffers 2 strain.

    <Description>
      [H3]Verpine Shatter Pistol[h3]
      [P]Verpine shatter guns are projectile weapons based on magnetic field technology, akin to rail guns. Shatter guns are nearly silent in their operation, though there is an audible crack as their metal alloy projectile breaks the speed of sound. Though the projectiles themselves are relatively small, the speed with which they impact the target inflicts a large amount of kinetic damage, and their effective range is exceptional.
[P]Shatter guns are available in a number of configurations, including pistols, rifles, and heavier versions
that can serve as sniper weapons. The Verpine are a largely peaceful species, and since they rarely have any call for violence, they only manufacture a small number of shatter guns for their own internal security. The scarcity of shatter guns that make it beyond the Roche Asteroid Field, along with their lethality and relative untraceability, results in the exorbitant prices of available models.
[P]The Rebel Alliance has secured a small number of shatter guns from the Verpine and issues them on an as-needed basis to operatives in the field. Shatter guns are notoriously delicate and must be cared for properly. If a shatter gun is dropped or jarred, it will cease to function until repaired. While wielding a shatter gun, any combat check that generates either [TH][TH] or [DE] damages the weapon by one step, as if struck by a weapon with the Sunder quality (see page 1 70 of the Ace of Rebellion Core Rulebook).

    <Name>Spore/B Stun Grenade</Name>
    <Description>
      [H3]Spore/B Stun Grenade[h3]
[P]Produced by Czerka Arms, the Spore/B stun grenade employs stun spores to disable opponents. Because the stun spores are airborne, the grenade is completely ineffective against targets wearing breath masks or sealed suits. That said, the grenade has proven incredibly effective—and even deadly—when used against unprotected targets.
[P]Upon detonation, the Spore/B stun grenade releases a dense cloud of stun spores. The spores enter the target’s respiratory system and slow the absorption of oxygen into the bloodstream, causing unconsciousness. Despite the claim that the Spore/B is a non-lethal weapon, a small percentage of organic beings experience respiratory failure when exposed to the spores.
[P]The first time a character is hit with an attack from this weapon (even if he suffers no damage), he must roll a single [CH] As long as the character doesn't roll a [DE] on this, he is affected normally by the Spore/B stun grenade. If the roll does result in a the character immediately suffers 6 strain and begins to suffocate. A Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Medicine check is required to stop the subject from suffocating.
[P]While the Spore/B isn’t the ideal non-lethal weapon, many spies still continue to use it against the Empire.

Wielded as a symbol of status by Mon Cal officers, the baton provides an effective sidearm in an unassuming package. The ribs along the length of the baton indicate the wielder’s rank, which provides a visual indication
of status to those nearby. More elaborate and decorative battle batons exist, but these are reserved for royalty and often incorporate precious metals, gems, and krakana pearls.
[P]Many Mon Calamari officers in the Rebel Alliance, including Admiral Ackbar, continue to carry the battle batons they were issued on Mon Cala.

    <Description>
      [H3]Salus DF-D1 Duo-Flechette Rifle[h3]
     [P]One of the most notorious weapons in the galaxy, the Salus DF-D1 duo-flechette rifle has earned something of a bad reputation due to use by indiscriminate assassins and bounty hunters. Given the weapon’s massive flechette spread and the high number grievous injuries it causes (especially in densely populated locales), collateral damage and unforeseen fatalities are almost guaranteed. Both local and Imperial law enforcement view the mere act of carrying a duo-flechette rifle as a serious crime; they have a tendency to shoot first and ask questions later when confronted with one.
[P]When activated, the DF-D1 fires twin canisters of needlelike flechettes from its stubby dual barrels. The flechettes lose speed quickly, ensuring the weapon’s range leaves something to be desired. Despite this shortcoming, the flechettes disperse into large clouds capable of affecting several targets at once.
[P]The DF-D1 is available in both personal and powered armor versions, and it is the primary weapon of the Leviathan series of powered armor. Both versions are identical for all intents and purposes, but the powered armor version is stripped down and incapable of individual use outside the armor’s systems.

      [H3]Koromondain SVT-300 Stun Cloak[h3]
[P]At first glance, the Koromondain SVT-300 stun cloak appears to be nothing more than a typical thermal cloak with a handsome metallic sheen. This sheen is produced by a series of special fibers that conduct a focused electrical charge across the cloak’s surface. Once the cloak has been activated by depressing a stud in its clasp, anyone who comes into contact with its exterior suffers an intense electrical discharge.
Though designed as a defensive weapon, the stun cloak can also be used offensively while grappling an opponent.
[P]If the wielder of the stun cloak is hit by a melee or brawl attack, the attacker suffers 7 damage. This damage is applied to the target’s strain threshold. This effect consumes one of the cloak’s payload of charges from its Limited Ammo quality.
[P]Once the cloak has expended its payload of three charges, the power source in its clasp must recharge for three minutes before it can be used again.

      [H3]G9-GX Pulse Drill[h3]
[P]Designed as a handheld complement to the tried-and-true C2-CE beamdrill, the C9-GX uses a variable-strength, continuous-beam plasma projector to perform all manner of jobs, from cutting to welding and brazing to incinerating waste material and industrial byproducts. [P]The G9-CX can be found in use in many of the excavations located throughout the tunnels of
Sullust. It consists of a long, bulky rod tipped by a variable-angle plasma cutter and connected by a reinforced cable to a control unit. The control unit contains the fuel cell and many of the controls that manage the power of the plasma stream. It is typically worn on a broad belt around the waist.

      [H3]Verpine Shatter Rifle[h3]
 [P]Verpine shatter guns are projectile weapons based on magnetic field technology, akin to rail guns. Shatter guns are nearly silent in their operation, though there is an audible crack as their metal alloy projectile breaks the speed of sound. Though the projectiles themselves are relatively small, the speed with which they impact the target inflicts a large amount of kinetic damage, and their effective range is exceptional.
[P]Shatter guns are available in a number of configurations, including pistols, rifles, and heavier versions
that can serve as sniper weapons. The Verpine are a largely peaceful species, and since they rarely have any call for violence, they only manufacture a small number of shatter guns for their own internal security. The scarcity of shatter guns that make it beyond the Roche Asteroid Field, along with their lethality and relative untraceability, results in the exorbitant prices of available models.
[P]The Rebel Alliance has secured a small number of shatter guns from the Verpine and issues them on an as-needed basis to operatives in the field. Shatter guns are notoriously delicate and must be cared for properly. If a shatter gun is dropped or jarred, it will cease to function until repaired. While wielding a shatter gun, any combat check that generates either [TH][TH] or [DE] damages the weapon by one step, as if struck by a weapon with the Sunder quality (see page 1 70 of the Ace of Rebellion Core Rulebook).

      [H3]Palandrix KO-2 Heavy Stun Pistol[h3]
[P]Known colloquially as a "coma pistol", the Palandrix KO-2 stands head and shoulders above other stun pistols in both power and range. Though as large as a typical heavy blaster pistol, the KO-2 is streamlined and lightweight due to the use of orbital alloys and high-density plastics in its construction. Given its size, the weapon is an intimidating sight in the hands of a trained professional.
[P]Primarily used by law enforcement organizations requiring an effective, non-lethal alternative to traditional blaster weapons, the KO-2 is generally seen only in the Core Worlds. The weapon has only recently seen use in the Outer RIm, and is generally harder to find the farther one gets from the galactic center. Despite its relative obscurity, the KO-2 continues to gain high marks for effectiveness and reliability.

      [H3]Security S-5 Heavy Blaster Pistol[h3]
[P]A pistol designed and manufactured by Theed Arms on Naboo, the Security S-5 is a reliable, versatile weapon. During the Clone Wars, it was a preferred weapon of the Royal Naboo Security Forces, and it remains a popular choice for private security groups, bodyguards and other blaster connoisseurs. Its under-barrel dart launcher can be configured to launch solid projectiles of various sorts; one particularly common choice is a grappling hook attached to a cable, which wielders can use to anchor themselves to nearby objects, swing across gaps, and safely descend into drops.
[P]As an action, a character may make an Average ([DI][DI]) Ranged (Light) check to secure the grappling hook to an object within medium range. On success, as an action, he may reel in the cord, pulling himself to the object (or, if the object is unsecured and lighter than he is, pulling it to him). A character may use the grappling hook to pull another character aloft with him; if he does, he must make an Average ([DI][DI]) Athletics check to avoid losing his grip on either his partner or his gun.

      [H3]Site-145 Replica Blaster Pistol[h3]
[P]Though the Jedi Order was primarily known for its use of lightsabers, there have been countless other Force traditions throughout the galaxy's long and murky history, and many fought with other weapons. One such ancient culture used blasters with Force-attuned triggers, and examples of these weapons have been found in archaeological sites across the galaxy. The best preserved relics were non-functional when discovered at so-called "Site-145" on the third moon of Filata, but not all members of the expedition were content to study this history purely in the abstract. Sokiro Terebin, an artificer and antiquarian of the Jedi Order who lived just prior to the Clone Wars, constructed a number of replicas as museum pieces, and her notes and blueprints were recorded in various archives. Though fully functional as weapons (in the hands of Force-sensitives, anyway), these armaments were largely viewed as historical curiosities during the days of the Republic and were rarely (if ever) used. Since the rise of the Empire, these pieces (and the blueprints to build them) have disappeared onto the black market, where the command a reasonably high price as contraband items related to the Jedi.
[P]The Site-145 replica blaster pistol automatically features the Force-attuned resonator weapon attachment (see page 54 of Keeping the Peace).
[P][H4]&lt;font size=1&gt;Please see page 43 of the Keeping the Peace sourcebook for details.&lt;/font&gt;[h4]

      [H3]BlasTech DLS-12 Heavy Blaster Carbine[h3]
[P]The DLS-12 is a specialized version of the larger DLT-19 heavy blaster rifle. While it possesses many of the same features at the DLT-19, the DLS-12's barrel has been shortened to reduce its bulk. Obviously, the shorter barrel results in reduced range, but given that it is designed for close assault, this is not considered a major drawback.
[P]Designed during the last few months of the Clone Wars, the DLS-12 saw limited use by Republic forces. Republic (and, later Imperial) troops tended to eschew it in favor of heavy blaster rifles, though some specialized units prefer its shorter range and lighter weight. As a result, surplus heavy blaster carbines have found their way into arsenals across the galaxy.

[P]Shield gauntlets are specialized defensive items popularized by the Kilian Rangers of Kilia IV. Appearing to be little more than a high-tech gauntlet, a shield gauntlet projects a protective, concave energy field of indistinct coloration. Though these unique items are used primarily by members of the Kilian Rangers, both as a defensive item and as a reminder of their oath to defend themselves and their families, a handful of shield gauntlets have found their way into the hands of collectors, black marketeers, and Force sensitives.
[P]A shield gauntlet counts as a Lightsaber weapon for the purposes of the Reflect talent (see page 150 of the Force and Destiny core rulebook).

[P]An energy buckler consists of a metallic disc worn on the wielder's wrist. Once active, the disk projects a small, circular shield that can be used to block melee attacks. Given the nature of the energy shield, it can also be used a s a melee weapon to bash targets with a stunning blow. Though an active energy buckler projects of a relatively nondescript circular energy field, the projector disks themselves are often decorated to appear as mundane jewelry. An energy buckler has steep power requirements and can only be used for a short period of time before it must be recharged.
[P]When the wielder is using an energy buckler, the GM can spend any [DE] the wielder generates on a combat check to have the energy buckler run out of power; it ceases to function until the end of the encounter or until recharged.

[P]Electronets were once preferred by the Republic Scout Service when capturing newly discovered animals on alien worlds. They have since become popular with bounty hunters and law enforcers the galaxy over. Constructed of duracord with interwoven stun threads or beads, electronets can be manually draped over targets to ensnare them. They are also capable of being loaded into net guns for ranged applications, or used as ground traps by canny hunters. Traditional activation of an electronet is accomplished with a handheld transmitter to avoid unintentionally stunning the user. Alternatively, a user might wear insulated gloves to protect against the nets incapacitating charge.

Even against weapons not easily deflected directly, such as lightsabers, an off-hand vibroblade can force attackers to consider strikes cautiously, lest they leave themselves vulnerable to counterattacks with the short blade.

[P]Developed by Rodian hunters as an offensive weapon, the cryogen whip appears to be little more than an offensive whip with an outer coating of metal rungs. The cryogen whip's relatively mundane outer appearance belies the fact that supercooled cryogen circulates at its core, chilling the outer panels When properly used, the whip generates a stunning blast and a loud, earsplitting crack. The whip's coils also conduct the cryogen's frigid temperature, leaving targets covered in frostbitten welts and cuts. 
[P]This weapon can be used to make melee attacks against targets at up to short range (the difficulty remains Average ([DI][DI])).

      [H3]Parrying Dagger[h3]
[P]Typically used in the off hand, the traditional parrying dagger consists of a slim, double-edged blade with a wide (sometimes forked) guard or a basket hilt for hand protection. In addition to possessing defensive utility, a parrying dagger can be used offensively, often as part of a feint or riposte. Traditional on many worlds where advanced technology is rare or melee duels are part of the culture, such blades can be found across the galaxy.

      [H3]Snap Baton[h3]
[P]Snap batons are light, collapsible truncheons often employed by law enforcers and bounty hunters. With little more than a flick of the wrist, the baton can be extended to its full one-meter length. Once extended, the baton's weighted end can be used to inflict serious injury on opponents. Due to the nature of the baton's construction, it provides a solid and punishing weapon in a very small package. Collapsing a snap baton requires that a stud be depressed while the wielder pushed it back into the handle.

      [H3]Sith Shield[h3]
[P]The shields used by Sith warriors in ages past can still be found, though they are rare in the extreme. Resembling ordinary shields at first glance, Sith shields are crafted from an alchemical alloy and are often decorated with unsettling carvings, reliefs and runes. They are virtually impenetrable, even to lightsabers, and these shields are incredibly deadly in the hands of a trained dark side adept. When used in combat by a Force user, Sith shields absorb the hate of combatants around them, drawing upon the building fury of their users and any foes engaged in the struggle.
[P]Whenever a Force-sensitive wielder of a Sith shield suffers a hit in combat, he may commit [FO] to channel his fury into the shield as an out of turn incidental. Over multiple attacks, he may commit multiple [FO] this way, up to a total number [FO] no greater than his force rating.
[P]AS an action, the wielder may uncommit all [FO] committed to the Sith shield to unleash the stored power in a torrent of hate. When he does so, he gains Conflict equal to the number of [FO] he had committed to the shield and then he makes a Force power check with that many [FO]. He may spend [FP] to inflict 1 wound and 1 strain (these ignore soak) on each other character within short range of him; he may activate this multiple times, inflicting 1 additional wound and 1 additional strain each time.

      [H3]Guard Shoto[h3]
[P]Similar to the shoto lightsaber, the guard shoto or lightsaber tonfa, is a lightsaber with its grip set perpendicular to the blade, allowing the wielder to rapidly switch between attack and defense, deflecting bolts and blows one moment and lashing out with circular attacks of blinding speed the next. While these versatile weapons are extremely difficult to master, they can be startlingly effective, especially when paired with cortosis gauntlets to protect against slips of the blade.
[P]The lightsaber is a guard shoto hilt containing an unmodded Illum lightsaber crystal (see page 197 of the Force and Destiny core rulebook). This crystal occupies two of the weapons hardpoints.
[P]When installing a lightsaber crystal into a guard shoto, decrease the damage of that lightsaber crystal by 1.

    <Description>
      [H3]Temple Guard Lightsaber Pike[h3]
[P]The Jedi Temple Guard were the elite defenders of the Jedi Temple in the days of old, tasked with maintaining order and protecting those who resided within. Traditionally, these guardians wielded special double-bladed lightsabers with a long handle and could fight with one or both ends ignited. Though few of the weapons of these legendary protectors survived the fall of the Jedi temple, rumors say that some of these weapons might have survived the destruction of their wielders. The force might well lead one still believes in the ideals of the Jedi Temple Guard to one of their ancient symbols of dedication and honor.
[P]For the purposes of gameplay, this weapon is treated as having a single crystal. This lightsaber is a double-bladed lightsaber hilt containing an unmodded Illum crystal (see page 197 of the Force and Destiny core rulebook). This crystal occupies two of the weapon's hardpoints.
[P]When purchasing attachments for this weapon (including crystals), each attachment costs double the listed price. This represents the fact that the double-bladed saber generally requires two of each attachment (one for each end). However, when installing and modding these attachments, follow all normal rules.
[P]A Temple Guard Lightsaber pike requires two hands to wield.

[P]The Renegade is the most powerful blaster pistol ever manufactured by SoroSuub. Popular with pirates and smugglers, the weapon is large and intimidating without being cumbersome and unwieldy. Due to its reliability, it’s also favored by Rebel SpecOps troops and vehicle crews. Though the weapon’s range is comparable to that of a typical heavy blaster pistol, the sacrifices made to increase its damage cause it to be somewhat inaccurate.

    <Description>[H3]BlasTech DL-19C Blaster Pistol[h3]

BlasTech's venerable DL-18 is one of the more common blaster pistols across the galaxy, and has been a considerable success for BlasTech for years. The DL-19C is a much more specialized weapon, targeted at a niche market of weapon hobbyists, perfectionists, and others who want the ability to adjust every aspect of the weapon to their personal taste, from the sensitivity of the trigger, to the shape of the barrel, to the energy outflow form the charge pack. While these guns are produced in limited number, discerning firearms enthusiasts often recognize each other based on possession of this weapon.

[P]When a character applies the Jury Rigged talent to this weapon, he may select one additional option from the talent's list and apply it to the weapon. The character cannot select the same option twice.

    <Description>[H3]DDC-MR6 Modular Rifle[h3]

A modular rifle that the Drearian Defense Conglomerate designed for the Confederacy of the Independent Systems during the Clone Wars, the MR6 comes with an electromagnetic rail system that enables the user to reconfigure the weapon quickly for different situations. The "rails" (actually electromagnetic strips along the body of the rifle) allow a user to quickly swap attachments, even in the heat of battle. Due to the high cost of the weapon, the Separatists never purchased more than an experimental manufacturing run before moving on to cheaper alternatives. Nonetheless, a few of these rare guns remain in circulation, in the hands of collectors or mercenaries who need a versatile weapon that fulfills a wide variety of needs.

[P] A character may make an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b] to add or remove an attachment to a DDC-MR6 as an action rather than spending the usual time required to remove an attachment.

An electromag-pulse disruptor devices is a slim stylus used to short out electronic equipment. While some Technicians who work with droids or computer systems that might run out of control need such a device in their daily work, having one on hand can be helpful to anyone who ends up in a combat situation. In the Core Worlds, machinists rarely need to concern themselves with such risks, but in the Outer Rim, where marauders and pirates about, possession of such a device can mean the difference between life and death.

    <Description> [H3]Ion Thruster Gun[h3]

Ion thrusters are used in many different engines, from those of airspeeders to the drives of grand starships. Most Technicians have at least one or two fo these devices sitting around their workspaces at any given time, and a hangar is liable to contain many thrusters. As many Technicians can tell you, however, the biggest difference between a powerful engine and a gun is where they happen to be pointed. A retrofitted ion thruster's actual capacity for damage is low due to the diffuse nature of the blast, but it knocks objects over, and the ion signature disrupts droids and electronics.

    <Description>[H3]Multi-Goo Gun[h3]

The multi-goo gun, an all-in-one spray injector, has a self-cleaning element that allows Technicians to switch out lubricant, adhesive, or acid cartridges with no loss in function. The device appeals to many machinists' natural affinity for efficiency, enabling users to switch between substances quickly without stopping their work, rather than having to stop, clean their spray injectors, and load them with a new substance at each step of a project.

[P]A character using this tool gains automatic [AD] on Mechanics checks to repair droids, vehicles, or starships.

[P]The GM may spend [TH][TH] or [DE] on a Mechanics or combat check made using a multi-goo gun to have all of its spray cartridges run out; it cannot be used at all until refilled. A pack that includes replacements for all three substances costs 20 credits and has a rarity of 2. Placing a refill pack in a multi-goo gun requires an action.

    <Description>[H3]Rivet Gun[h3]

Most rivet guns work around the principle of a basic pneumatic hammer, and fire bolts into vehicle plating. Of course, some rivet guns are more potent than others, based on the thickness and density of the plating they are intended to secure. As such, a Technician can easily adapt a more powerful rivet gun into a serviceable slugthrower by ignoring a few of the safety operating protocols, such as "keep cartridge pressure at or beneath printed factory settings" and "never point the rivet gun at living creatures or droids." While rivet guns are hardly combat weapons, and thus only function up close and with minimal accuracy, no wise sentient would completely ignore the threat presented by an irate Technician carrying one.

[P]A rivet gun reduces the difficulty of Mechanics checks to repair Critical Hits on vehicles and starships by 1 (to a minimum of [B]Simple [-][b]).

A hand grinder uses a rotating wheel coated with rough material to polish down spurs and marks on metal surfaces. this can be extremely helpful when trying to get mechanical components to fit perfectly, whether these are the armored plates of a starship hull or the joints of a droid. While not as effective as a vibrosaw in terms of raw cutting power, it is perhaps even more intimidating.

[P]A hand grinder adds automatic [AD] to crafting checks that involve shaping large pieces of hardened material. A hand grinder requires two hands to use as a weapon.

    <Description>[H3]Welding Rod[h3]

Technicians need not only the ability to cut metal apart quickly, but the capacity to fuse it back together. A welding rod works on a simple principle, generating a jet of focused heat that liquefies small parts of two or more pieces of metal, creating a sturdy bond between the formerly separate pieces. The heat involved in this process is extremely dangerous to organic creatures, and can even sear clean through the much sturdier limbs of droids. For good reason, welding rods are typically sold with instruction manuals that highlight the danger involved in their use – which some Technicians choose to actively ignore when threatened in their workshops.

[P]A welding rod adds automatic [SU] to Mechanics checks to repair droids, vehicles, and starships.

[P]The GM may spend [DE] on any check made with a welding rod to inflict a Critical Injury (see page 216 of the [B]Edge of the Empire[b] Core Rulebook) on the user.

    <Name>Master Lodaka's Lightsaber</Name>
    <Description>[H3]Master Lodaka's Lightsaber (Lothal)[h3]

In the galaxy at large, if Lothal is known at all, it is as an Imperial world home to a Sienar Fleet Systems production line for TIE fighters. Some Imperials also know it as a source of Rebel activity. But for generations of Jedi, the planet was known for its hidden temple, which safeguarded a Force-shrouded source of the kyber crystals utilized in lightsaber construction.

[P]Hidden deep within the temple are the remains of the Rodian Jedi Lodaka. An unparalleled master of the third form of lightsaber dueling, Soresu, the rodian was unusual among the Jedi for also spending much of her time mastering a discipline not often though of in conjunction with the order: physics. Specifically, Lodaka was fascinated by the material properties of the various crystals used in lightsaber construction, and she took a disciplined, reasoned approach to their study. A true scientist, she made careful, controlled experiments with many forms of crystals, both natural and manufactured, concentrating her efforts on modifications in the form of chemical coatings. She theorized that the effects of the different forms of crystals used in lightsabers could be enhanced by manipulating the crystalline structure of the base crystal. Although she used modern grav-field projectors and micromanipulators to conduct her experiments, it is thought she only achieved success when she manipulated the crystals on a molecular level using the Force.

[P]All of Lodaka's notes and papers were either destroyed or taken when the Jedi Temple on Coruscant was overrun following the implementation of Order 66. Only one of the crystals she modified is thought to still exist, and it is the one in her own lightsaber, which remains with her body on Lothal. It represented Lodaka's finest work, as the particular modification she applied at least partially addressed a problem that had vexed lightsaber wielders for thousands of years.

[H4]Game Effects[h4]

Master Lodaka's Lightsaber is a weapon with the following profile: (Lightsaber; Damage 10; Critical 1; Range [Engaged], Breach 1, Sunder, Vicious 2).

[P]Master Lodaka's Lightsaber has an encumbrance of 1 and zero hard points. Attacks made with this lightsaber ignore the Cortosis quality. It also cannot be shut down due to contact with refined cortosis.

Although Auraterans have access to modern energy weapons, the simple but reliable boomerang is still a popular weapon for local hunters and trappers. The weapon takes skill to use, and many an enthusiastic amateur has lost her boomerang by throwing it into a tree or off a cliff. But if thrown correctly, the boomerang either hits its target or spins around in mid-air, then hitting the original target on the return flight or landing in the user's hand.

[P]If retrieved, a thrown boomerang can be used again. A character may spend [AD] on a missed attack (including an attack made with the Guided quality) to have the boomerang return to the user's hand.

Plasma balls vary in size, with versions roughly twenty centimeters in diameter associated with most handheld weapons. They are especially dangerous to droids and mechanical devices.

    <Description>[H3]Longbow[h3]

Much less technically sophisticated than a blaster, a longbow remains a deadly weapon in properly trained hands. The quiet twang of a bowstring also does not carry nearly as far as the firing sounds of a blaster or slugthrower. In a primitive environment, characters separated from technological resources can fashion arrows from natural materials far more easily than they can develop a charging system for an energy weapon.

[P]However, a longbow is a large weapon, even the smallest models being well over a meter in length. Good arrows, nearly a meter long, are also awkward to carry and extremely difficult to conceal. A longbow is an unusual and distinctive sight on most of the galaxy's worlds. Passersby are likely to remember seeing a warrior who chooses to carry one in place of a more common weapon.

[P]A longbow requires a supply of arrows to fire; if the GM needs to set a price, she can charge 1 credit per arrow (or a few copper pieces on Weik).

    <Description>[H3]Energy Slingshot[h3]

Less a weapon than a device for mischievous pranksters, the energy slingshot is a wrist-mounted device. The user points her wrist at the target, pulls back the energized "cup" and, when she releases it, the slingshot fires a disorienting shock-burst over short distances. The shock-burst is non-lethal, but very annoying, meaning that this "weapon" is legal on most worlds. Plenty of municipalities even allow minors to purchase it, to the chagrin of law enforcement officers who have to put up with being pelted by shock-bursts from rowdy young hooligans.

[P]Triggering the Disorient quality on this weapon requires [AD], instead of [AD][AD].

    <Description>[H3]Bardottan Electrolance[h3]

Bardottans traditionally wield a one-handed lance as a ceremonial weapon. Lances hold a cultural significance to the species, as Bardottans have used them as their preferred melee weapon since long before the incorporation of modern technologies. Modern electrolances are similar to force pikes in that they emit a powerful blast when striking the target. They can also be set to stun. This setting is most commonly implemented when used by law enforcement personnel seeking to incapacitate a suspect for further questioning.

[P]The grip of the Bardottan electrolance is placed in the middle of the weapon. The lance is carried like a walking stick, with the longer end extended above the wielder's head. It is the longer end that is used to strike a foe. In combat, the shorter end is typically pivoted to parry incoming attacks. The shorter end also incorporates a counterweight, making it better balanced for one-handed use.

[P]The Bardotta electrolance is a one-handed weapon, however it cannot be wielded with other weapons. It may, at the GM's discretion, be wielded while using a shield.

    <Description>[H3]Gungan Electropole[h3]

Gungan herders traditionally use electropoles to guide and guard their shaaks. Though it is essentially a peasant weapon, familiarity led the Gungan militia members to incorporate it into their military traditions. While herders typically used the weapon while afoot, militias often use electropoles while mounted upon kaadu. Its relatively low weight makes it well suited for use in one hand while controlling a mount with the other. Because electropoles were designed for controlling cattle as well as scaring off predators, the weapons incorporate both stun and deadly settings. The electronic components of an electropole are watertight, so they can be used effectively on land or underwater.

[P]An electropole may be thrown as a ranged weapon. If used in this manner, change the skill to Ranged (Light) and the range of the weapon to short. The weapon also gains the Limited Ammo 1 quality (but can be retrieved and used again).

    <Description>[H3]Gungan Personal Energy Shield[h3]

Gungan engineering incorporates a particularly advanced understanding of shielding technologies. Their underwater cities make use of shielding extensively. Even their offensive weapons are designed around encasing a ball of high-energy plasma within a temporary energy shield. It is hardly surprising, then, that they are one of the few species that have successfully designed an easily portable defensive shield.

[P]The Gungan personal energy shield is sized to the wearer. It is worn on the user's off-hand arm, so that a weapon can be wielded in the other. Notably, it does not completely encase the user in a secure field. Rather, it only offers defense against attacks coming from a single orientation. To benefit from the shield, the wielder must be able to focus on deflecting attacks.

[P]The value of the Gungan personal energy shield's Defensive quality is reduced to 0 while the wielder is suffering from the staggered or disoriented condition.

The Jedi have used lightsabers for so long that most forget there may have been a time when they had no access to energy weapons. However, on worlds with Force traditions but no ready access to energy weapons, other devices were used. The s0-called "training stick" looks to be nothing more than a simple walking stick, but is perfectly balanced to be used as a duelist's weapon. Although most commonly found in the hands of an apprentice, some master swordfighters prefer the simple training stick as a non-lethal weapon that, to the untrained eye, appears to be nothing more than an elder's cane.

[P]This weapon appears to be a harmless cane. Add [SE][SE][SE] to a character's Perception or Vigilance checks to discern this weapons true nature.

A spear is essentially a blade at the end of a long pole, typically about two meters in length. In a pinch, tying a combat knife to the end of a reasonably straight branch is enough to fashion a spear. A less hastily constructed version incorporates a double-edged blade as well as a shaft that is made of a material sturdy enough to parry other weapons. The city guard of Vossport on Weik prefer heavy, long spears as their primary weapon, as they are simple to master and versatile.

Regardless of technological advances, a simple metal sword remains an effective and reliable weapon. A sword never runs out fo power. It is heavy enough and long enough to give a warrior a significant advantage in combat against an unarmed opponent or one wielding a more compact weapon. Legends suggest that long before the invention of the lightsaber, the earliest Force adepts used swords as their preferred weapons. A greatsword permits a wielder to employ a tremendous amount of power and leverage to each swing.

[P]The greatsword requires two hand to wield.

Designed for cold-weather expeditions, the Copora-Tech Thermal Cutter is basically a scaled-down mining beamdrill. The handheld device projects a heat beam that can evaporate snow and cut through ice, making it invaluable for digging snow shelters on inhospitable worlds.

[P]A thermal cutter's charge lasts for roughly five minutes of continuous use, and can remove one cubic meter of snow per minute, or dig through 10 centimeters of ice per minute. If plugged into a fusion lantern, it can run indefinitely, otherwise it requires a new battery. Nefarious individuals can also use a thermal cutter as a weapon
